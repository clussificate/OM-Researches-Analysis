The supply chains that support online retailing are fundamentally different from those that support traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Traditional solutions are not always appropriate to solve online retailing’s operations problems; thus, there is an opportunity to understand and improve these novel supply chains. One key characteristic of the inventory systems for online retailing is demand spillover, whereby a stockout at a fulfillment center (FC) results in demand spilling over to another FC. For this context we examine how to allocate inventory to the FCs under a periodic-review joint-replenishment policy, with an objective to minimize outbound shipping costs for a fixed amount of inventory. We first show how traditional decentralized allocation policies may perform suboptimally and induce dynamics (whiplash) that result in costly spillover. We find that this phenomenon increases with the prevalence of local stockouts and with the level of inventory imbalance. We then describe that inventory imbalance occurs in online retailing because of operational realities and provide evidence based on real data. Finally, we propose a heuristic to allocate inventory accounting for possible spillover during the lead time. We test the heuristic by a simulation and show that it performs better than the status quo policy, is robust to operational realities, and captures over 90% of the possible improvement as compared to a pseudo-optimal policy.|Jason Acimovic | Stephen C.

We then point out that the joint convexity concept depends on whether S and T are continuous or discrete variables, and in some situations it may not even be well defined. Nonetheless, we are able to identify several useful properties of the cost function, such as submodularity and coordinatewise convexity.

Craig, Ananth Raman|The Ohio State University, Columbus, Ohio 43210;Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts 02163|retailing; pricing and revenue management; inventory theory and control; OM practice; OM finance interface|Store liquidation is the time-constrained divestment of retail outlets through an in-store sale of inventory. The retail industry depends extensively on store liquidation, both to allow managers of going concerns to divest stores in efforts to enhance performance and as a means for investors to recover capital from failed ventures. Retailers sell billions of dollars of inventory annually during store liquidations. This paper introduces the store liquidation problem to the literature and presents a technique for optimizing key store liquidation decisions, including markdowns, inventory transfers, and the timing of store closings. We propose a heuristic for solving the store liquidation problem and evaluate the performance of this method. Through applications, we show that our approach could improve net recovery on cost (i.e., the profit obtained during a liquidation stated as a percentage of the cost value of liquidated inventory) by two to five percentage points in the cases we examined. Further, we discuss ways in which current practice in store liquidation differs from the decisions identified by our method, and we trace the consequences of these differences.|Nathan C.

This problem is commonly known in the location literature as the facility location problem with immobile servers, stochastic demand, and congestion. It is often set up as a network of M/M/1 queues and modeled as a nonlinear mixed-integer program (MIP). Because of the complexity of the resulting model, the current literature focuses on approximate and/or heuristic solution methods. This paper proposes a linearization based on a simple transformation and piecewise linear approximations and an exact solution method based on cutting planes.

We develop methods for interday and dynamic intraday forecasting of incoming call volumes. Our approach is to treat the intraday call volume profiles as a high-dimensional vector time series. We propose first to reduce the dimensionality by singular value decomposition of the matrix of historical intraday profiles and then to apply time series and regression techniques. Our approach takes into account both interday (or day-to-day) dynamics and intraday (or within-day) patterns of call arrivals. Distributional forecasts are also developed. The proposed methods are data driven, appear to be robust against model assumptions in our simulation studies, and are shown to be very competitive in out-of-sample forecast comparisons using two real data sets. Our methods are computationally fast; it is therefore feasible to use them for real-time dynamic forecasting.|Haipeng Shen| Jianhua Z.

Although it is clear that self-service can reduce cost, less is known about how customers utilize self-service channels in a multichannel service delivery system and the resulting impact on firm performance. An important aspect of service operations is that customers are coproducers of the service. Thus, the performance of the delivery system and customers' use of service channels can be affected by customers' own efficiency or productivity in service coproduction (customer efficiency). In this paper, we utilize prior theoretical frameworks in service operations and economics to hypothesize relationships among customer characteristics (especially coproduction efficiency), channel utilization, and firm performance. We then test these hypotheses using panel data from a large retail bank. Overall, we find that higher customer efficiency in self-service channels is associated with greater profitability and has a complex relationship with customer retention and product utilization.|Mei Xue| Lorin M.

Given limited display capacity and no a priori information on consumers' utility, the retailer must select which subset of products to offer. By offering different assortments and observing the resulting purchase behavior, the retailer learns about consumer preferences, but this experimentation should be balanced with the goal of maximizing revenues. We develop a family of dynamic policies that judiciously balance the aforementioned trade-off between exploration and exploitation, and prove that their performance cannot be improved upon in a precise mathematical sense. One salient feature of these policies is that they “quickly” recognize, and hence limit experimentation on, strictly suboptimal products.|Denis Sauré| Assaf Zeevi|||||||||Swanson School of Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260|Graduate School of Business, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

In this paper, we use proprietary data pertaining to an apparel retailer to study the relationship between store traffic, labor, and sales performance. We decompose sales volume into conversion rate (defined as the ratio of number of transactions to traffic) and basket value (defined as the ratio of sales volume to number of transactions) and analyze the impact of traffic on sales and its components. We find that store sales volume exhibits diminishing returns to scale with respect to traffic, and labor moderates the impact of traffic on sales. For example, we find that for values of traffic and labor corresponding to the mean, increasing average traffic per hour by one unit increases average sales volume per hour by $9.97. Further, we find that the marginal returns to traffic increases from $10.00 to $11.32 when labor increases by one standard deviation. In addition, we find that the conversion rate declines with increasing traffic and a lower conversion rate is associated with a decrease in future traffic growth.

As in many practical settings, the supply chain members progressively observe market signals that enable them to explain future demand. The demand itself evolves according to an auto-regressive time series. We examine three types of supply chain configurations. In the first setting, the retailer and the supplier coordinate their policy parameters in an attempt to minimize systemwide costs, but they do not share their observations of market signals. In the second setting, resembling many original vendor-managed inventory (VMI) programs, the supplier takes the full responsibility of managing the supply chain's inventory, but the retailer's observations of market signals are not transferred to him. In our third setting, reminiscent of collaborative forecasting and replenishment partnerships, inventory is managed centrally, and all demand related information is shared. We propose a set of stylized models to study the three settings and use them to provide managerial insights into the value of information sharing, VMI, and collaborative forecasting.|Yossi Aviv||||||||||Olin School of Business, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri 63130||||||||||USA|||||||||

A common mitigation strategy is for the buying firm to expend effort improving the reliability of its supply base. We explore a model in which a firm can source from multiple suppliers and/or exert effort to improve supplier reliability. For both random capacity and random yield types of supply uncertainty, we propose a model of process improvement in which improvement efforts (if successful) increase supplier reliability in the sense that the delivered quantity (for any given order quantity) is stochastically larger after improvement. We characterize the optimal procurement quantities and improvement efforts and generate managerial insights. For random capacity, improvement is increasingly favored over dual sourcing as the supplier cost heterogeneity increases, but dual sourcing is favored over improvement if the supplier reliability heterogeneity is high. In the random yield model, increasing cost heterogeneity can reduce the attractiveness of improvement, and improvement can be favored over dual sourcing if the reliability heterogeneity is high. A combined strategy (improvement and dual sourcing) can provide significant value if suppliers are very unreliable and/or capacity is low relative to demand.|Yimin Wang| Wendell Gilland| Brian Tomlin||||||||W.

We show that despite the risk of intensifying future competition, open technologies by competing manufacturers may constitute an equilibrium and can indeed induce supplier investments. In addition, we identify a technology-risk-pooling benefit; namely, by opening technologies, competing manufacturers can induce supplier investments in both technologies and later adopt the one preferred by the market. However, manufacturers may also exhibit the prisoner’s dilemma and close their technologies despite the risk-pooling benefit. In this case, there is potential for collaborative technology sharing through cross licensing.

The firm strives to maximize its total expected revenues over a finite horizon, either by choosing a dynamic pricing strategy for each product or, if prices are fixed, by selecting a dynamic rule that controls the allocation of capacity to requests for the different products. This paper shows how these well-studied revenue management problems can be reduced to a common formulation in which the firm controls the aggregate rate at which all products jointly consume resource capacity, highlighting their common structure, and in some cases leading to algorithmic simplifications through the reduction in the control dimension of the associated optimization problems. In the context of their associated deterministic (fluid) formulations, this reduction leads to a closed-form characterization of the optimal controls, and suggests several natural static and dynamic pricing heuristics. These are analyzed asymptotically and through an extensive numerical study. In the context of the former, we show that “resolving” the fluid heuristic achieves asymptotically optimal performance under fluid scaling.|Constantinos Maglaras| Joern Meissner|||||||||Columbia Business School, Columbia University, 409 Uris Hall, 3022 Broadway, New York, New York 10027|Lancaster University Management School, Lancaster University, Room A48, Lancaster LA1 4XY, United Kingdom|||||||||USA|UNITED KINGDOM||||||||

The model extends the newsvendor problem with pricing by allowing for multiple suppliers, the pooling of procurement resources, and more general informational dynamics. One contribution is the solution procedure: We show that all decisions (up to 7 in all, including recourse decisions) can be determined uniquely as a function of a surrogate first-period decision called the stocking factor. Hence, the two-period decision problem with recourse reduces to a search for one decision variable. A second contribution is the policy implications: We find that the cost of learning is (1) a consequence of censored information because, on the margin, learning is free if full information is guaranteed; (2) measured in the form of an increased stocking factor; and (3) shared with the consumer in the form of a higher selling price when demand uncertainty is additive. A third contribution is the application of the results to three motivating examples: a market research problem in which a product is introduced in a test market prior to a widespread launch; a global newsvendor problem in which a seasonal product is sold in two different countries with nonoverlapping selling seasons; and a minimum-quantity commitment problem in which procurement resources for multiple purchases may be pooled.|Nicholas C.

We generalize standard auction models to include this salient feature of FAs and analyze this model theoretically and numerically. First, we show that FAs are subject to a sort of winner’s curse that in equilibrium induces higher expected buying prices relative to running first-price auctions as needs arise. Then, our results provide concrete design recommendations that alleviate this issue and decrease buying prices in FAs, highlighting the importance of (i) monitoring the price charged at the open market by the FA winner to bound the buying price; (ii) implementing price indexes for the random part of suppliers’ costs; and (iii) allowing suppliers the flexibility to reduce their prices to compete with the open market throughout the selling horizon.

We develop a simple stochastic dynamic program to model how an entrepreneur should prioritize between improving processes to reduce crises versus harvesting revenue or ensuring future growth. We show that it is initially optimal to prioritize process improvement: an entrepreneur should strive for high process quality early in the venture’s growth process. We numerically analyze a simple heuristic derived from this optimal policy and identify the conditions under which it is (or is not) effective. It performs near optimally except when process quality or revenue rate may deteriorate too fast or when the cost of process improvement or revenue enhancement is too high.

In this paper we quantify how empirically calibrated model errors concerning the futures term structure affect the valuation and hedging of natural gas storage. We find that even small model errors—on the order of 1%–2% of the empirical futures price variance—can have a disproportionate impact on storage valuation and hedging. In particular, theoretically equivalent hedging strategies have very different sensitivities to model error, with one natural strategy exhibiting potentially catastrophic performance in the presence of small model errors. We propose effective approaches to mitigate the negative effect of futures term-structure model error on hedging, also taking into account futures contract illiquidity, and provide theoretical justification for some of these approaches. Beyond commodity storage, our analysis has relevance for other real and financial options that depend on futures term-structure dynamics, as well as for inventory, production, and capacity investment policies that rely on demand-forecast term structures.|Nicola Secomandi| Guoming Lai| François Margot| Alan Scheller-Wolf| Duane J.

Yet, several firms avoid planned obsolescence and instead offer products with high durability. In this paper, we offer a demand-side rationale for a high-durability product design strategy: the exclusivity-seeking consumer behavior associated with conspicuous consumption. In the presence of consumers who value exclusivity, we find that firms benefit from designing products with higher durability in conjunction with a high-price, low-volume introduction strategy. A higher durability in such a context leads to greater resale value, allowing the firm to charge a higher price and lower the sales volume to achieve the product exclusivity valued by the consumers. This contrasts with the planned obsolescence strategy that capitalizes on the high sales volume achieved by setting a low new product price. We also show that offering higher durability and charging a higher price are complementary levers to respond to consumers who value exclusivity. Our analysis unearths insights regarding the effect of exclusivity-seeking behavior on a firm’s demand and pricing. We show that firms’ durability choice may explain the joint increase in price and demand for conspicuous goods.|Vishal V. Agrawal| Stylianos Kavadias| L.

Capacity for the new product can be acquired both by purchasing new production lines and by converting existing production lines for the old product. Furthermore, in either case, the new product capacity is “retrofitted” to be flexible, i.e., to be able to also produce the old product. This capacity planning problem arises regularly at Intel, which served as the motivating context for this research. We formulate a two-product capacity planning model to determine the equipment purchase and conversion schedule, considering (i) time-varying and uncertain demand, (ii) dedicated and flexible capacity, (iii) inventory and equipment costs, and (iv) a chance-constrained service-level requirement. We develop a solution approach that accounts for the risk-pooling benefit of flexible capacity (a closed-loop planning approach) and compare it with a solution that is similar to Intel's current practice (an open-loop planning approach). We evaluate both approaches with a realistic but disguised example and show that the closed-loop planning solution leads to savings in both equipment and inventory costs and matches more closely the service-level targets for the two products. Our numerical experiments illuminate the cost trade-offs between purchasing new capacity and converting old capacity and between a level capacity plan versus a chase capacity plan.|Hongmin Li| Stephen C.

First, knowledge spillover among firms enables free dissemination of new technologies and produces investment synergies. Second, knowledge spillover also causes free riding: in equilibrium, firms underinvest in R&D expecting to benefit from investments by others. Third, debt financing creates incentive for risk shifting: equity holders overinvest in riskier R&D projects. We study how interactions among these forces affect a firm’s investment decisions and equilibrium industry outcomes using a three-stage game between two firms and the external debt market. We characterize subgame perfect, Pareto-dominant equilibria and show that for some parameter choices, free riding and risk shifting cancel each other in the decisions of individual firms, resulting in the first-best investments. Interestingly, for some cases, the equilibrium with first-best investments becomes possible only when risk shifting by one firm enables free riding by the other firm. We also show that debt can be used by firms as a commitment device in a multistage game. This value of debt is shared with investors, who can earn positive profits despite being perfectly competitive. This enriches the understanding of the financial pecking order theory by showing that even firms with unlimited internal capital may prefer external debt financing.|Jie Ning | Volodymyr Babich |||||||||Weatherhead School of Management, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106|McDonough School of Business, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

Before execution, it was unclear if this proactive customer education would have positive or negative effects on customer retention and demand for technology support. We show the treatment reduces by half the number of customers who churn from the service during the first week. Further, treated customers ask 19.55% fewer questions during the first week of their tenure than the controls. Although the treatment’s effects decay within one week, we show that such proactive customer education can have significant economic benefits for the provider. In particular, we find that treated customers increase their accumulated usage of the service by 46.57% in the eight months after sign-up. Finally, we provide evidence that the effects of the treatment are strongest among customers who have less experience with the provider.|German F. Retana| Chris Forman| D. J.

As a result, a consumer may find an acceptable product in one retailer but nevertheless purchase nothing, opting to search other retailers for an even better product. We study several models of retail assortment planning, some of which explicitly account for consumer search and one that does not, which we call the “no-search” model. Even though the no-search model never includes an unprofitable variant in the assortment, in the presence of consumer search, it may indeed be optimal to include an unprofitable variant. Furthermore, we find that the no-search model can lead to an assortment with an expected total profit that is significantly less than optimal. In the extreme, the no-search model may recommend closing down a category (i.e., carry no variants) even if a profitable assortment exists (a 100% profit loss). We conclude that failing to incorporate consumer search into an assortment planning process may cause a retailer to underestimate the substantial value a broad assortment has in preventing consumer search.

The parameters that shape the agreement between aggregators and EV owners, such as plug-in duration and guaranteed driving range, affect the appeal of signing up with an aggregator. Our study examines how these contract parameters influence the profitability of vehicle pools. We use a bottom-up model that encompasses the entire planning problem faced by an aggregator. The model is applied to the German secondary reserve market using actual driving patterns and market data. Our results indicate that contract parameters influence EVs’ value to aggregators in surprising ways, partially contradicting findings in previous literature. In essence, high levels of plug-in durations or low levels of guaranteed driving for planned trips do not necessarily provide the highest profit. Furthermore, we find that realistic nonanticipative strategies lead to annual profits in the range of €167 to €125 per vehicle, which is in the lower range of previous studies. Our results are a starting point for a discussion about optimal contract parameters and the design of corresponding marketing strategies.|Gerald Broneske| David Wozabal|||||||||TUM School of Management, Technical University of Munich, 80333 Munich, Germany|TUM School of Management, Technical University of Munich, 80333 Munich, Germany|||||||||GERMANY|GERMANY||||||||

reshoring"|We consider a firm that solicits bids from a fixed-sized pool of yet-to-be-qualified suppliers for an indivisible contract. The contract can only be awarded to a supplier who passes a multistage qualification process. For each stage of the qualification process, the buyer incurs a fixed testing cost for each supplier she chooses to test. The buyer seeks an optimal mechanism—that is, one that minimizes her total expected cost. Motivated by the buyer’s urgency (or the lack of it) of time for completing the qualification process, we obtain optimal mechanisms for two testing environments: (1) simultaneous testing, where in each stage, the buyer selects a subset of those suppliers who have passed all the previous stages and tests them simultaneously; and (2) nonsimultaneous testing, where the simultaneous-testing requirement is not imposed. Under simultaneous testing, the admission policy for selecting suppliers at each stage is based on nonuniform reserve-price thresholds. Under nonsimultaneous testing, too, the admission policy is threshold based, but the selection process is sequential in nature. The relative increase in cost due to the simultaneous-testing requirement is (under a mild condition) monotonically increasing in the number of suppliers, the expected multistage testing cost, and the overall passing probability. We also study the optimal sequencing of the qualification stages and show that the buyer should schedule the stages in increasing order of the ratio of their testing cost to their failing probability. Finally, for the simpler setting of a single-stage qualification process and a single supplier, we study a two-dimensional mechanism design problem where, in addition to cost, the passing probability is also private to the supplier. Here, too, threshold-based admission remains optimal, and the buyer offers either a pooling or a separating contract.|Wei Chen | Milind Dawande | Ganesh Janakiraman ||||||||School of Business, University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas 66045|Naveen Jindal School of Management, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75080|Naveen Jindal School of Management, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75080||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

An arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is often considered the gold standard for delivering HD due to better patient survival, higher quality of life, and fewer complications. However, AVFs have some limitations: they require surgery, it takes approximately three months to know whether the surgery was successful, and a majority of these surgeries end in failure. Conversely, another common vascular access, the central venous catheter, can be inserted via a simple procedure and used immediately after placement. In this research, we address the question of whether and when to perform AVF surgery on incident and established HD patients, with the aim of finding individualized policies that maximize a patient’s probability of survival and remaining quality-adjusted life expectancy. Using a continuous-time dynamic programming model and under certain data-driven assumptions, we establish structural properties of the optimal policy for each objective.

Even if demand is stationary, managers are held accountable for performance over a finite horizon. In a finite horizon, the fill rate is a random variable. Studying the distribution is relevant because a vendor may be subject to financial penalty if she fails to achieve her target fill rate over a specified finite period. It is known that for a zero lead time, base-stock model, the expected value of a finite-horizon fill rate exceeds the long-run fill rate. In this paper, I investigate the behavior of the distribution of the finite-horizon fill rate when a stationary base-stock policy is used to control inventory. For a vendor facing a finite-horizon, fill-rate-level contract and using a stationary stocking policy, I examine how the the length of the review horizon (i.e., monthly or quarterly), the demand distribution, and the cost of failing to meet the target affect the stocking decision.|Douglas J.

We consider a firm producing substitutable products via a capacity portfolio consisting of both product-dedicated and flexible resources and characterize the structure of the optimal production and pricing decisions. We then explore how changes in various problem parameters affect the optimal policy structure. We show that the availability of a flexible resource helps maintain stable price differences across products over time even though the price of each product may fluctuate over time. This result has favorable ramifications from a marketing standpoint because it suggests that even when a firm applies a dynamic pricing strategy, it may still establish consistent price positioning among multiple products if it can employ a flexible replenishment resource.

Continuous (waveless) release constitutes an emerging alternative recently adopted by several firms. Although that new policy presents several advantages relative to waves, it requires more expensive technology and involves the possibility of congestion-induced collapse (gridlock) at the sorter. Using an extensive data set of detailed warehouse flow information from a leading U.S. online retailer, we first develop a model with validated predictive accuracy for a warehouse operating under waveless release. We then use that model to compute operational guidelines for dynamically managing the main control lever of that policy with the goal of maximizing throughput while keeping the risk of gridlock under a specified threshold.

Birge|Northwestern University, Technological Institute, Evanston, Illinois 60208-3100|real options; stochastic programming; financial optimization|Manufacturing and service operations decisions depend critically on capacity and resource limits. These limits directly affect the risk inherent in those decisions. While risk consideration is well developed in finance through efficient market theory and the capital asset pricing model, operations management models do not generally adopt these principles. One reason for this apparent inconsistency may be that analysis of an operational model does not reveal the level of risk until the model is solved. Using results from option pricing theory, we show that this inconsistency can be avoided in a wide range of planning models. By assuming the availability of market hedges, we show that risk can be incorporated into planning models by adjusting capacity and resource levels. The result resolves some possible inconsistencies between finance and operations and provides a financial basis for many planning problems. We illustrate the proposed approach using a capacity-planning example.|John R. Birge||||||||||Northwestern University, Technological Institute, Evanston, Illinois 60208-3100||||||||||USA|||||||||

When a retailer forecasts demand based on past sales observations, it requires an estimation approach that accounts for this censoring. Several authors have analyzed inventory management with demand learning in environments with censored observations, but the authors assume that inventory levels are known and hence that stockouts are observed. However, firms often do not know how many units of inventory are available to meet demand, a phenomenon known as inventory record inaccuracy. We investigate the impact of this unknown on demand estimation in an environment with censored observations. When the firm does not account for inventory uncertainty when estimating demand, we discover and characterize a systematic downward bias in demand estimation under typical assumptions on the distribution of inventory record inaccuracies. We propose and test a heuristic prescription that relies on a single error statistic and that sharply reduces this bias.|Adam J.

The model is an M/M/1 queue with homogeneous patients and exponential reneging. Patients join the waiting system and organ transplants are reflected by the service process. In addition, unlike the standard M/M/1 model, each service instance is associated with a variable reward that reflects the quality of the transplant organ, and patients have the option to refuse an organ (service) offer if they expect future offers to be better. Under an assumption of perfect and complete information, it is demonstrated that the queueing discipline is a potent instrument that can be used to maximize social welfare. In particular, first-come-first-serve (FCFS) amplifies patients' desire to refuse offers of marginal quality, and generates excessive organ wastage. By contrast, last-come-first-serve (LCFS) contains the inefficiencies engendered by patient choice and achieves optimal organ utilization. A numerical example calibrated using data from the U.S. transplantation system demonstrates that the welfare improvements possible from a better control of patient choice are equivalent to a 25% increase in the supply of organs.|Xuanming Su| Stefanos Zenios|||||||||Walter A.

This added flexibility increases the decision space for U-line layouts and can result in better balanced lines. This paper examines the impact of stochastic task times on the relative performance of U-line and straight-line layouts. Several analytical and simulation results are presented, and insights are provided to explain the difference in the performance of U-line and straight-line layouts.

For electronic products, life cycles are measured in units of months, with 6- to 12-month life cycles being common. Given these short product life cycles, product demand is increasingly difficult to forecast. Furthermore, demand is never really stationary because the demand rate evolves over the life of the product. In this paper, we consider the problem of where in a supply chain to place strategic safety stocks to provide a high level of service to the final customer with minimum cost. We extend our model for stationary demand to the case of nonstationary demand, as might occur for products with short life cycles. We assume that we can model the supply chain as a network, that each stage in the supply chain operates with a periodic review base-stock policy, that demand is bounded, and that there is a guaranteed service time between every stage and its customers. We consider a constant service time (CST) policy for which the safety stock locations are stationary; the actual safety stock levels change as the demand process changes. We show that the optimization algorithm for the case of stationary demand extends directly to determining the safety stocks when demand is nonstationary for a CST policy. We then examine with an illustrative example how well the CST policy performs relative to a dynamic policy that dynamically modifies the service times. In addition, we report on numerical tests that demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed solution and how it would be deployed.|Stephen C. Graves| Sean P.

Such a policy has been widely adopted by retailers. We examine the impact of a posterior PM policy on consumers' purchasing behavior, a seller's pricing and inventory decisions, and their expected payoffs, assuming that the seller cannot credibly commit to a price path, but can implement a posterior PM policy. We find that the PM policy eliminates strategic consumers' waiting incentive and thus allows the seller to increase price in the regular selling season. When the fraction of strategic consumers is not too small and their valuation decline over time is neither too low nor too high, the PM policy can substantially improve the seller's profit, as well as the inventory investment. In such situations, the strategic consumers' waiting incentive and the loss if they wait are both high. However, to adopt this policy, the seller also bears the refund cost. The seller must either pay the refund that consumers will claim or forgo the salvage value of any leftover inventory. The PM policy can be detrimental when there are only a few strategic consumers or the strategic consumers' valuation decline is very low or very high. We find that the performance of this policy is insensitive to the proportion of consumers who claim the refund. From the consumers' perspective, the PM policy generally reduces consumer surplus; however, there are cases where consumer surplus can be increased, typically when the variance of the potential high-end market volume is high. As a result, a Pareto improvement on both the seller's and the consumers' payoffs is possible. Finally, we find that the ability to credibly commit to a fixed price path is not very valuable when the seller can implement price matching.|Guoming Lai| Laurens G.

There are many practical situations that reasonably conform to those assumptions, but the traditional newsvendor model also assumes a fixed salvage value: all inventory left over at the end of the season is sold off at a fixed per-unit price. The fixed salvage value assumption is questionable when a clearance price is rationally chosen in response to the events observed during the selling season: a deep discount should be taken if there is plenty of inventory remaining at the end of the season, whereas a shallow discount is appropriate for a product with higher than expected demand. This paper solves for the optimal order quantity in the newsvendor model, assuming rational clearance pricing. We then study the performance of the traditional newsvendor model. The key to effective implementation of the traditional newsvendor model is choosing an appropriate fixed salvage value. (We show that an optimal order quantity cannot be generally achieved by merely enhancing the traditional newsvendor model to include a nonlinear salvage value function.) We demonstrate that several intuitive methods for estimating the salvage value can lead to an excessively large order quantity and a substantial profit loss. Even though the traditional model can result in poor performance, the model seems as if it is working correctly: the order quantity chosen is optimal given the salvage value inputted to the model, and the observed salvage value given the chosen order quantity equals the inputted one. We discuss how to estimate a salvage value that leads the traditional newsvendor model to the optimal or near-optimal order quantity. Our results highlight the importance of understanding how a model can interact with its own inputs: when inputs to a model are influenced by the decisions of the model, care is needed to appreciate how that interaction influences the decisions recommended by the model and how the model’s inputs should be estimated.|Gérard P.

Erlang-R accommodates customers who return to service several times during their sojourn within the system, and its modeling power is most pronounced in time-varying environments. Indeed, it was motivated by healthcare systems, in which offered-loads vary over time and patients often go through a repetitive service process. Erlang-R helps answer questions such as how many servers (physicians/nurses) are required to achieve predetermined service levels. Formally, it is merely a two-station open queueing network, which, in a steady state, evolves like an Erlang-C (M/M/s) model. In time-varying environments, on the other hand, the situation differs: here one must account for the reentrant nature of service to avoid excessive staffing costs or undesirable service levels. We validate Erlang-R against an emergency ward (EW) operating under normal conditions as well as during a mass casualty event (MCE). In both scenarios, we apply time-varying fluid and diffusion approximations: the EW is critically loaded and the MCE is overloaded. In particular, for the EW we propose a time-varying square-root staffing policy, based on the modified offered-load, which is proved to perform well over small-to-large systems.|Galit B.

Customers arrive according to a Poisson process and are heterogeneous in their marginal valuation of the quality level. Customers make product choices to maximize a linear utility function of price, quality level, and waiting cost. Resulting product demands are met through capacity investments in production processes, which are modeled as queuing systems. We consider two different types of production processes: product-focused, dedicated to the production of a single-product variant; and product-flexible, processing all product variants in the product line. Capacity investment and variable production costs are functions of the processed product's quality. We develop an integrated marketing-operations model that provides insights on the factors determining the right level of product variety to offer, the relative quality positioning of the products in the line, the resulting market coverage and segmentation, and the effects on production costs and congestion levels of the processes. We show that the statistical economies of scale resulting from the congestion phenomena in the production system impose limits on the optimal product variety. For product-focused processes the market size promotes a higher optimal product variety, whereas the per-unit capacity investment and customer waiting costs act as deterrents for higher product variety. For product-flexible processes optimal product variety also depends on the specific type of flexibility and the ratio of capacity investment to variable production costs.|Sergio Chayet| Panos Kouvelis| Dennis Z.

The supplier receives orders from customers belonging to several demand classes. Some of the customer classes share advance demand information with the supplier by announcing their orders ahead of their due date. However, this advance demand information is not perfect because the customer may decide to order prior to or later than the expected due date or may decide to cancel the order altogether. Customer classes vary in their demand rates, expected due dates, cancellation probabilities, and shortage costs. The supplier must decide when to produce and, whenever an order becomes due, whether or not to satisfy it from on-hand inventory. Hence, the supplier is faced with a joint production-control and inventory-allocation problem. We formulate the problem as a Markov decision process and characterize the structure of the optimal policy. We show that the optimal production policy is a state-dependent base-stock policy with a base-stock level that is nondecreasing in the number of announced orders. We show that the optimal inventory-allocation policy is a state-dependent multilevel rationing policy, with the rationing level for each class nondecreasing in the number of announced orders (regardless of whether the class provides advance information).

The retailers each have access to a demand signal and can exchange signals (horizontal information sharing). The suppliers can offer the retailers differential payments to gain access to their signals (vertical information acquisition). We demonstrate that retailer competition is a necessary condition to sustain information flow, whereas supplier competition precludes vertical information acquisition. Facing horizontal competition, the retailers can have an incentive to exchange signals if competition is less intense; and this incentive is stronger when they order from independent suppliers than when they order from a monopolist supplier. In the setting where two retailers order from a monopolist supplier, once the retailers exchange signals, the supplier will acquire signals from them both; otherwise, it will have an incentive to acquire signals if the signals are sufficiently correlated. It can be incentive compatible for horizontal information sharing and vertical information acquisition to coexist so that the retailers’ signals are available to all parties. Under this circumstance, the supplier will profit from information flow and the retailers can earn profit gains as well, whereas the consumers will be worse off.|Li Jiang| Zhongyuan Hao|||||||||Faculty of Business, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, China|Faculty of Business, The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, China|||||||||CHINA|CHINA||||||||

Thus, the agents tend to have different skills, in different combinations. In such an environment, it is challenging to route calls effectively and determine the staff requirements. This paper addresses both of these routing and staffing problems by exploiting limited cross-training. Consistent with the literature on flexible manufacturing, we find that minimal flexibility can provide great benefits: Simulation experiments show that when (1) the service-time distribution does not depend on the call type or the agent and (2) each agent has only two skills, in appropriate combinations, the performance is almost as good as when each agent has all skills. We apply this flexibility property to develop an algorithm for both routing and staffing, aiming to minimize the total staff subject to per-class performance constraints. With appropriate flexibility, it suffices to use a suboptimal routing algorithm. Simulation experiments show that the overall procedure can be remarkably effective: The required staff with limited cross-training can be nearly the same as if all agents had all skills. Hence, the overall algorithm is nearly optimal for that scenario.|Rodney B.

The paper provides a general modelling framework to analyze the ties between market segmentation decisions, incentives, and process performance in such service-delivery systems. The firm is modelled as a single-server queue, in a principal-agent framework. Customers have different value-generation potentials whose realizations are observed by the server but not by the manager of the firm. The manager determines a market segmentation scheme given an overall customer value-generation profile, which divides customers into two groups (high and low), and also determines a service level for each segment. The server decides which of the two available service levels (high and low) to provide for each customer, given a compensation scheme offered by the manager. The optimal market segmentation decision, optimal service-level choice, and a set of optimal linear incentive contracts that enable their implementation are characterized. The robustness of these strategies is explored with respect to model parameters and assumptions. It is shown that a market segmentation scheme that combines revenue generation concerns with their process implications is essential for success.

service operations"|Problem definition: We study optimal scheduling of customers in service systems, such as call centers. In such systems, customers typically hang up and abandon the system if their wait for service is too long. Such abandonments are detrimental for the system, and so managers typically use scheduling as a tool to mitigate it. In this paper, we study the interplay between customer impatience and scheduling decisions when managing heterogeneous customer classes. Academic/practical relevance: Call centers constitute a large industry that has a global spending of around $300 billion and employs more than 15 million people worldwide. Our work focuses on improving call center operations, which can reduce costs and improve customer satisfaction. Mathematically, customer patience is typically modeled as exponentially distributed for tractability. Our work makes inroads into relaxing this restrictive assumption to allow modeling more realistic call center situations. Methodology: We use heavy traffic–motivated asymptotic queueing machinery that provides us the traction to successfully capture and incorporate the customer impatience distribution into the scheduling problem. In our approach, the scheduling problem reduces to a diffusion control problem, which we solve to propose near-optimal scheduling policies. Results: We propose near-optimal scheduling policies that can be implemented by call centers to improve their quality-of-service metrics. One of our main results is that, for a class of parameters, we establish sufficient conditions for both the optimality and nonoptimality of threshold policies. Managerial implications: Threshold policies are widely used for scheduling. Our work provides additional insight into whether these may be suboptimal. Our work provides an easy-to-implement alternative that can reduce customer abandonments considerably; for instance, our numerical results indicate that for a system with two customer types, the abandonment rate of one class can be lowered by 30% by using our policy relative to the best threshold policy.|Jeunghyun Kim | Ramandeep S.

Each customer arrives with a preference list and will purchase the highest-ranking offered product in her preference list. We assume the set of customer classes is derived from paths in a tree, in which the order of nodes visited along each path gives the corresponding preference list. First, we study assortment problems, in which the goal is to find which products to offer to maximize expected revenue. We give a dynamic programming solution, which can be extended to versions of the assortment problem in which there are fixed costs for offering a product, shelf constraints, or substitution costs. Second, we study the joint assortment and pricing problem, in which the goal is to simultaneously select the set of offered products as well as their prices. We solve the pricing problem optimally when customers have some universal ranking of the products, and hence the tree takes the form of a single path. We also solve the problem optimally on the general tree when the prices are restricted to be quality consistent; higher-quality products must be priced above lower-quality products. Finally, we present computational experiments on both synthetic data and real hotel purchase data. Our estimation procedure shows both how to build the tree of products and how to estimate the underlying arrival probabilities of each customer type from historical sales data.

This paper investigates how to improve the performance of such a supply chain. Specifically, we consider a serial inventory system in which each stage implements a local reorder interval policy; i.e., each stage orders up to a local base-stock level according to a fixed-interval schedule. A fixed cost is incurred for placing an order. Two improvement strategies are considered: (1) expanding the information flow by acquiring real-time demand information and (2) accelerating the material flow via flexible deliveries. The first strategy leads to a reorder interval policy with full information; the second strategy leads to a reorder point policy with local information. Both policies have been studied in the literature. Thus, to assess the benefit of these strategies, we analyze the local reorder interval policy. We develop a bottom-up recursion to evaluate the system cost and provide a method to obtain the optimal policy. A numerical study shows the following: Increasing the flexibility of deliveries lowers costs more than does expanding information flow; the fixed order costs and the system lead times are key drivers that determine the effectiveness of these improvement strategies. In addition, we find that using optimal batch sizes in the reorder point policy and demand rate to infer reorder intervals may lead to significant cost inefficiency.|Kevin H. Shang| Sean X.

When a customer demand occurs at a stocked-out retailer, that retailer requests a unit to be transshipped from another retailer who charges a transshipment price. If this request is rejected, the unsatisfied customer may go to another retailer with a customer overflow probability. Each retailer decides on the initial order quantity from a manufacturer and on the acceptance/rejection of each transshipment request. For two retailers, we show that retailers' optimal transshipment policies are dynamic and characterized by chronologically nonincreasing inventory holdback levels. We analytically study the sensitivity of holdback levels to explain interesting findings, such as smaller retailers and geographically distant retailers benefit more from transshipments. Numerical experiments show that retailers substantially benefit from using optimal transshipment policies compared to no sharing.

Most catalogers and online sellers, in addition to some traditional retailers, use upselling often to clear inventories of slow-moving items. We investigate the pricing and discounting questions for such an item, which we call the promotional product. In our model, an arriving customer may purchase this promotional product or one of the other products that the firm sells. If the customer purchases one of the other products, the promotional product is offered to the customer, possibly with a discount. While deciding whether to offer a discount and, if so, how big a discount to offer, the firm uses the information that the customer has just bought a certain product with a certain price. We investigate how discounting decisions depend on the inventory levels, time, type of pricing policy in use, and the relationship between the customers' reservation prices for the promotional product and the other products (negatively or positively correlated). In particular, we find that if the firm sets prices and discounts dynamically and the customers' reservation prices for the promotional product are negatively correlated with their reservation prices for the product they purchased, then customers are always offered a discount regardless of the inventory levels and time. On the other hand, if the customers' reservation prices for the promotional product are positively correlated with their reservation prices for the product they purchased, then the customer may or may not be offered a discount, depending on the inventory levels and time. Our numerical study shows that the benefit to the firm from using customer purchase information is high when the firm uses a static price, but chooses discounts dynamically. We also find that although dynamic discounting decisions bring modest improvements, setting the price dynamically seems to have a more significant effect on the firm's profits.|Goker Aydin| Serhan Ziya|||||||||Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109|Department of Statistics and Operations Research, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

In turn, such waiting lowers the firm’s profitability and increases the firm’s bankruptcy risk. Using a two-period model to capture these dynamics, this paper identifies customers' strategic waiting behavior as a source of a firm’s cost of financial distress. We also find that customers' anticipation of bankruptcy can be self-fulfilling: when customers anticipate a high bankruptcy probability, they prefer to delay their purchases, making the firm more likely to go bankrupt than when customers anticipate a low probability of bankruptcy. Such behavior has important operational and financial implications. First, the firm acts more conservatively when facing either more severe financial distress or a large share of strategic customers. As its financial situation deteriorates, the firm lowers inventory alone when financial distress is mild or only a small share of customers are strategic and lowers both inventory and price in the presence of severe financial distress and a large fraction of strategic customers. Under optimal price and inventory decisions, strategic waiting accounts for a large part of the firm’s total cost of financial distress, although a larger proportion of strategic customers may result in a lower probability of bankruptcy. In addition to inventory reduction and (immediate) price discount, we find that a deferred discount, in the form of rebates and/or store credits for future purchases, can act as an effective mechanism to mitigate strategic waiting. As a contingent price reduction, deferred discounts align the interests of customers and the firm and are most effective when the fraction of strategic customers is high and the firm’s financial distress is at a medium level.|John R.

IDMs both design and manufacture semiconductor devices, whereas foundries concentrate only on manufacturing. Because production capacity is capital intensive, IDMs often make decisions on whether to manufacture each device internally or subcontract to foundries. Two types of contracts are most frequently used in such settings. Under α-contracts, a fixed fraction α of ex post realized demand is committed to subcontract to the foundry and serves as an incentive for the foundry to build capacity. Under reservation contracts, an ex ante capacity reservation fee is paid to the foundry as an incentive to build capacity. Because of the different nature of incentives under these contracts, it is unclear which type of contract maximizes the IDM's expected profit. Furthermore, IDMs and their customers often prefer dual sourcing to sole sourcing for risk-management purposes. This paper studies the relationship between the two types of contracts, both with and without dual-sourcing constraints and shows the effect of a dual-sourcing preference on contract selection.

This can be accomplished in several ways, including online tracking of packages, ensuring on-time delivery, and offering residential pickups. Some companies want their drivers to develop relationships with customers on a route and have the same drivers visit the same customers at roughly the same time on each day that the customers need service. These service requirements, together with traditional constraints on vehicle capacity and route length, define a variant of the classical capacitated vehicle routing problem, which we call the consistent VRP (ConVRP). In this paper, we formulate the problem as a mixed-integer program and develop an algorithm to solve the ConVRP that is based on the record-to-record travel algorithm. We compare the performance of our algorithm to the optimal mixed-integer program solutions for a set of small problems and then apply our algorithm to five simulated data sets with 1,000 customers and a real-world data set with more than 3,700 customers. We provide a technique for generating ConVRP benchmark problems from vehicle routing problem instances given in the literature and provide our solutions to these instances.

In contrast, the recipient’s benefits from knowledge transfer may be lagged because of the difficulties in articulating and documenting knowledge as well as the challenges regarding its interpretation and application. Over time, as each team embeds knowledge in the NPD project, the levels of product and process performance increase, thereby increasing the net revenue earned at the product launch time. In a key contribution to the literature, analytic conditions are given that characterize the dynamic rates at which knowledge development and knowledge transfer occur throughout the project.

However, there is little empirical research on the practicality and effectiveness of choice-based RM models. Toward this end, we report the results of a study of choice-based RM conducted with a major U.S. airline. Our study had two main objectives: (1) to assess the extent to which choice models can be estimated well using readily available airline data, and (2) to gauge the potential impact that choice-based RM could have on a sample of test markets.|Gustavo Vulcano| Garrett van Ryzin| Wassim Chaar||||||||Leonard N.

In this paper, we consider an inventory system in which inventory records are inaccurate. The manager makes inventory inspection and replenishment decisions at the beginning of each period. There is a cost associated with each inspection. If an inspection is performed, inventory records are aligned with physical inventory. The objective is to develop a joint inspection and replenishment policy that minimizes total costs in a finite horizon. We prove that an inspection adjusted base-stock (IABS) policy is optimal for the single-period problem. In the finite-horizon problem, we show that the IABS policy is near optimal in a numerical study. Under this policy, the manager performs an inspection if the inventory recorded is less than a threshold level, and orders up to a base-stock level that depends on the number of periods since the last inspection. The prevalent approach to deal with inventory inaccuracy in practice is to implement cycle-count programs. Based on the structure of the IABS policy, we propose a new cycle-count policy with state-dependent base-stock levels (CCABS). We show that CCABS is almost as effective as the IABS policy. In addition, we provide guidelines for practitioners to design effective cycle-count programs by conducting sensitivity analyses on the IABS policy. Finally, by comparing the costs associated with these policies and several benchmark systems, we quantify the true value of accurate inventory information, which may be provided by radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems.|A.

This figure is expected to grow by 15 to 20% annually as manufacturing firms increasingly partner with third-party logistics providers to cost effectively distribute their products, while meeting increasingly stringent service expectations of customers. These logistics partnerships have introduced a new set of decision requirements to negotiate compensation for distribution services. Based on a collaborative project with a leading building products manufacturer, this paper describes the development and implementation of a novel linear programming model to decide the delivery fees paid to distributors. The model applies to manufacturer-distributor partnerships where distributors are compensated using fee values that depend on delivery weights and distances. It ensures that the expected compensation, considering stochastic demands, is adequate to cover the aggregate distribution costs for each distributor, and permits imposing various consistency conditions to ensure that fee values are credible. The model proved effective in helping the manufacturer develop a new fee table that generated considerable economic savings and provided more equitable compensation to distributors.|Anantaram Balakrishnan| Harihara Prasad Natarajan| Michael S.

For this purpose, we consider two retailers that compete in terms of inventory: customers that face a stockout at their first-choice store will look for the product at the other store. Consequently, the total demand that each retailer faces depends on the competitor's inventory level. We allow for asymmetric reordering capabilities, and we are particularly interested in the case when one of the firms has a lower ordering cost but can only produce at the beginning of the selling season, whereas the second firm has higher costs but can replenish stock in a quick response manner, taking advantage of any incremental knowledge about demand (if it is available). We visualize this problem as the competition between a traditional make-to-stock retailer that builds up inventory before the season starts versus a retailer with a responsive supply chain that can react to early demand information. We provide conditions for this game to have a unique pure-strategy subgame-perfect equilibrium, which then allows us to perform numerical comparative statics. We confirm that quick response is more beneficial when demand uncertainty is higher or exhibits a higher correlation over time. We also find that the competitive advantage from quick response is larger when facing a slow response competitor, and interestingly, asymmetric competition can be desirable to both competitors.|Felipe Caro| Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz|||||||||Anderson School of Management, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095|IESE Business School, University of Navarra, 08034 Barcelona, Spain|||||||||USA|SPAIN||||||||

To address procurement cost fluctuation, the firm adopts a dual-sourcing strategy, under which it procures from a spot market with immediate delivery and through a forward-buying contract with postponed delivery. Our analysis offers the unique insight that a risk-neutral firm may earn higher expected profit under a more volatile procurement cost process. This is because the firm makes its pricing and sourcing decisions in response to the realized cost in each period. Moreover, we characterize how the firm should dynamically adjust its pricing and sourcing decisions in accordance to cost evolution. For example, if sourcing through the forward-buying contract is less expensive than sourcing directly from the spot market, the optimal safety stock is decreasing in the current spot market purchasing cost. However, the optimal order quantity through the forward-buying contract is, in general, not monotone in the current spot-purchasing cost. Finally, we conduct extensive numerical experiments to show that dynamic pricing and dual sourcing may be either strategic complements or substitutes in the presence of fluctuating procurement costs and uncertain demand. This is because dynamic pricing mitigates demand uncertainty risk and exploits procurement cost fluctuation, whereas dual sourcing may either intensify or dampen demand risk.|Guang Xiao| Nan Yang| Renyu Zhang||||||||Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130|Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130|Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

While work-conserving policies are optimal for macrolevel measures, scheduling policies with strategic idleness (SI) might be helpful for microlevel measures. Using the empirical data obtained from the service provider, we provide statistical evidence that SI is used by its schedulers to manage the macro- and microlevel measures. However, the company has no specific rules on implementing SI and the schedulers make decisions based on their own experience. Our primary goal is to develop a systematic framework for the joint usage of SI with dynamic scheduling policies (DSPs). We suggest to use threshold-based policies to intelligently combine SI and DSPs and show that the resulting policies provide an efficient way to simultaneously address both macro- and microlevel measures.

Major goals of private nonindustrial forest owners are to achieve a steady flow of profits while reaching an overall satisfactory and reliable profit level. These goals are pursued under uncertainties in the growth of trees in different regions and in the prices of wood products. We propose an optimization framework that uses financial risk concepts to capture the above goals and uncertainties, and apply it to a real forestry problem in Finland. Our results demonstrate that the obtained harvesting schedules outperform those obtained without the explicit consideration of the stability and reliability requirements in harvest profits. More generally, our results indicate that the forest owner can improve the profit stability by (i) harvesting a greater number of forest stands early and (ii) harvesting in the first periods of the planning horizon stands that are predominantly composed of slow-growing forests. This research responds to the call for scenario-based approaches that represent well, and in a solvable way, multiple uncertainties in large forestry problems. This study fills in a gap in stochastic programming and can be a cornerstone for subsequent improvements in the solution of combinatorial chance-constrained problems with multirow random technology matrix.|Miguel A.

We then develop models to investigate the impact of demand and absentee rate variability on the performance of staffing plans and obtain some structural results. Utilizing these results, we propose and test three easy-to-use heuristics to identify near-optimal staffing strategies.

Past research on models incorporating component substitutions focuses on the benefits from reduced safety-stock requirements. This paper addresses a dynamic requirements-planning problem for two-stage multi product manufacturing systems with bill-of-materials flexibility, i.e., with options to use substitute components or subassemblies produced by an upstream stage to meet demand in each period at the downstream stage. We model the problem as an integer program, and describe a dynamic-programming solution method to find the production and substitution quantities that satisfy given multi period downstream demands at minimum total setup, production, conversion, and holding cost. This methodology can serve as a module in requirements-planning systems to plan opportunistic component substitutions based on relative future demands and production costs. Computational results using real data from an aluminum-tube manufacturer show that substitution can save, on average, 8.7% of manufacturing cost. We also apply the model to random problems with a simple product structure to develop insights regarding substitution behavior and impacts.|Anantaram Balakrishnan| Joseph Geunes|||||||||Smeal College of Business Administration, Penn State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802|Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, The University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

A firm's new product success depends on its ability to manage the product development process in a way that employs scarce resources to achieve the goal of the firm as well as the specific project's objectives. Simple and measurable performance metrics have been proposed and applied to monitor and compensate the development teams. In this paper, we develop a modeling frame work to analyze the implications of setting managerial priorities for three commonly used new product performance metrics: (1) time-to-market, (2) product performance, and (3) total development cost. We model new product development as a “product performance production” process that requires scarce development resources. Setting a target for development teams for each of these performance metrics can constrain this performance production process and, thereby, affect the other performance metrics. We model the constrained process as a restricted case of a general process that does not have such constraints. We benchmark each constrained process against the optimal, unrestricted process with respect to the level of the resource intensity employed during the development process, the time-to-market, and the performance level of the new product at launch. We show that an overly ambitious time-to-market target leads to an upward bias in resource intensity usage and a downward bias in product performance (i.e., evolutionary product innovation). In addition, our results suggest that the target time-to-market approach may ignore the effect of cannibalization and, thus, can perform suboptimally if a significant degree of cannibalization in the existing product market is expected. Given a target product performance, we show that the coordination between marketing and R&D is easier because the resulting development resource intensity and time-to-market decisions becomes separable. However, an overly ambitious product performance target leads to an upward bias in the development resource intensity and a delayed product launch that misses the window of opportunity. Finally, we show that the target development cost approach can lead a downward bias in product performance and a premature product launch. The above analyses are performed for a monopolistic firm, and they are extended to passive and active competitive environment.|Morris A. Cohen| Jehoshua Eliashberg| Teck H.

The e-tailer faces a joint pricing and fulfillment (JPF) optimization problem: at the beginning of each period, the e-tailer needs to jointly decide the price for each product and how to fulfill an incoming order (i.e., from which warehouse to ship the order). The objective of the e-tailer is to maximize its total expected profits defined as total expected revenues minus total expected shipping costs. (All other costs are fixed in this problem.) The exact optimal policy for JPF is difficult to solve; so, we propose two heuristic controls that have provably good performance compared to reasonable benchmarks. Our first heuristic control directly uses the solution of a deterministic approximation of JPF as its control parameters. Our second heuristic control improves the first one by adaptively adjusting the original control parameters according to the realized demand. An important feature of the second heuristic control is that it decouples the real-time pricing and fulfillment decisions, making it easy to implement. We show theoretically and numerically that the second heuristic control significantly outperforms the first heuristic control and is very close to a benchmark that jointly reoptimizes the full deterministic problem at the beginning of every period.|Yanzhe (Murray) Lei | Stefanus Jasin| Amitabh Sinha||||||||Stephen M.

These decisions turn out to depend intricately on the form of the delay costs seen by the customers; we characterize these decisions up to the dominant order in the scale for both convex and concave delay costs. We show that when serving customers on a first-come, first-served basis, if the customers' delay costs are strictly convex, the firm can increase its utilization and extract profits beyond what it can do when customers' delay costs are linear. However, with concave delay costs, the firm is forced to decrease its utilization and makes less profit than in the linear case. While studying concave delay costs, we demonstrate that these decisions depend on the scheduling policy employed as well. We show that employing the last-come, first-served rule in the concave case results in utilization and profit similar to the linear case, regardless of the actual form of the delay costs.|Sunil Kumar| Ramandeep S.

Demand from each source arrives dynamically according to an independent Poisson process. The cost of fulfilling each order depends on both the source of the order and its fulfillment location. Inventory at all locations is replenished from a shared production facility with a finite production capacity and stochastic production times. Consequently, supply lead times are load dependent and affected by congestion at the production facility. Our objective is to determine an optimal demand allocation and optimal inventory levels at each location so that the sum of transportation, inventory, and backorder costs is minimized. We formulate the problem as a nonlinear optimization problem and characterize the structure of the optimal allocation policy. We show that the optimal demand allocations are always discrete, with demand from each source always fulfilled entirely from a single inventory location. We use this discreteness property to reformulate the problems as a mixed-integer linear program and provide an exact solution procedure. We show that this discreteness property extends to systems with other forms of supply processes. However, we also show that supply systems exist for which the property does not hold. Using numerical results, we examine the impact of different parameters and provide some managerial insights.|Saif Benjaafar| Yanzhi Li| Dongsheng Xu| Samir Elhedhli|||||||Graduate Program in Industrial Engineering, Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455|Department of Management Sciences, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong|Department of Management Science, School of Business, Sun Yat-Sen University, Guangzhou, Guangdong 510275, China|Department of Management Sciences, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada|||||||USA|HONG KONG|CHINA|CANADA||||||

Hence, short-run quality improvement strategies are necessary, and, if possible, should complement (rather than substitute for) a longer run continuous improvement strategy with suppliers. We propose a novel short-run quality improvement strategy with suppliers which is based on a combinatorial optimization model for determining the optimal matching of raw material batches (from suppliers) with process variable parameters (of the manufacturer) by exploiting their interaction effects. Although the model can be difficult to solve, we develop sufficient conditions for a special case where the attainment of an optimal solution is straightforward. We demonstrate the use of the proposed approach in an actual pharmaceutical process. Using data from the pharmaceutical case, we develop several simulation scenarios where matching is shown (predicted) to greatly improve process yield. We also discuss the use of matching to illuminate various strategies for long-term continuous improvement of supplier and manufacturer processes in general.|Robert Plante| Herbert Moskowitz| Jen Tang| Jeff Duffy|||||||Krannert Graduate School of Management, Purdue University, 1310 Krannert Building, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907-1310|Krannert Graduate School of Management, Purdue University, 1310 Krannert Building, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907-1310|Krannert Graduate School of Management, Purdue University, 1310 Krannert Building, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907-1310|Krannert Graduate School of Management, Purdue University, 1310 Krannert Building, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907-1310|||||||USA|USA|USA|USA||||||

During peak periods, the energy supplier offers the manufacturing firm—the energy user—an incentive program to reduce its energy usage by shutting down its production facility. Participation in the incentive program, however, is totally voluntary, and the user firm is rewarded for each unit of time that it participates in the program. We consider two problems that face the manufacturing firm. The first is whether it is worth shutting down production to participate in the incentive program when it is offered, and in which part (portion) of the peak period the firm should participate. The second problem is how the firm should decide on its production policy in both the peak and nonpeak periods in the presence of such an incentive program. In this paper, we provide simple models to give insight into the nature of these problems. Two cases are studied. In the first case, the peak duration is assumed to be exponentially distributed, and in the second, its length becomes known at the beginning of a peak period. In both cases, the occurrence times of the peak periods are uncertain. We characterize the optimal production and shutdown policy for both the peak and nonpeak periods. We also study the effect of seasonality on the optimal control policies.|Xiuli Chao| Frank Y.

To investigate these relationships, we use data on publicly traded utility firms operating coal-fired generating units regulated by the U.S. Acid Rain Program from three principal sources: the U.S. Energy Information Administration, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Compustat database. Our results indicate a significant relationship between better environmental performance and lower firm market performance over at least a three-year period. From a regulatory perspective, our results show a negative association between allowance grandfathering and firm environmental performance.

Therefore, its effective management must include the control of the timing of the delivery of each of the service's elements and the enhancement of the customer's experience between and during the delivery of the various elements. This paper provides a conceptual framework that links the duration of a service encounter to behaviors that have been shown to affect profitability. Analysis of the framework reveals a wide gap between the behavioral assumptions typically made in operations research (OR) and operations management (OM) models and the state of the art in the marketing and psychology literature. The central motivations behind this paper are (1) to help the OR and OM community bridge this gap by bringing to its attention recent findings from the behavioral literature that have implications for the design of queueing systems for service firms and (2) to identify opportunities for further research.|Gabriel R.

Knowing these costs, manufacturers book available production days in a first-come-first-serve order to optimize their individual cost. The cost for each manufacturer consists of booking and work-in-progress costs, as expressed by the weighted flow time. When window booking is completed, the third party identifies a schedule that minimizes the total cost incurred by all manufacturers. This coordination reduces the total cost but may result in higher costs for a subset of manufacturers. For this reason, the third party devises a savings sharing scheme with which the monetary benefit for each manufacturer is greater. In this article we present algorithms for the problem considered, as well as savings-sharing schemes that make coordination a better alternative for all parties. The highlight of our experiments is that the costs of the production chain can be reduced by an average of 32% if one-third of the members let the third party cover their increased work-in-progress cost in exchange for 38%–53% of the total savings.|Tolga Aydinliyim| George L.

We create an analytical model of a tandem queue with finite buffer space to analyze the impact of different work prioritization policies on the throughput and the flow time of patients in the facility—measures that influence both the facility's finances and patients' satisfaction. We derive throughput-optimal policies and show that these policies involve dynamic batching. This finding is interesting because our model does not include any setup times, and setup times normally imply batching; rather it is the uncertain service times and the requirement for simultaneous service in the conference step that make batching optimal. The optimal dynamic batching policy is complex, so we consider a simpler static batching policy. We show that, in systems with limited buffer space, large batches can sometimes degrade efficiency by simultaneously increasing flow time and decreasing throughput. However, in general, both flow time and throughput increase with batch size. Flow time increases at a faster rate than throughput, so hospital management may want to consider what batch size is optimal given the value it places on the two measures.|Gregory Dobson| Hsiao-Hui Lee| Arvind Sainathan| Vera Tilson|||||||Simon School, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York 14627|School of Business, University of Hong Kong, Pok Fu Lam, Hong Kong|Nanyang Business School, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 639798|Simon School, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York 14627|||||||USA|HONG KONG|SINGAPORE|USA||||||

These platforms may charge consumers prices and pay providers wages that both adjust based on prevailing demand conditions. For example, Uber uses a “surge pricing” policy, which pays providers a fixed commission of its dynamic price. With a stylized model that yields analytical and numerical results, we study several pricing schemes that could be implemented on a service platform, including surge pricing. We find that the optimal contract substantially increases the platform’s profit relative to contracts that have a fixed price or fixed wage (or both), and although surge pricing is not optimal, it generally achieves nearly the optimal profit. Despite its merits for the platform, surge pricing has been criticized because of concerns for the welfare of providers and consumers. In our model, as labor becomes more expensive, providers and consumers are better off with surge pricing because providers are better utilized and consumers benefit both from lower prices during normal demand and expanded access to service during peak demand. We conclude, in contrast to popular criticism, that all stakeholders can benefit from the use of surge pricing on a platform with self-scheduling capacity.|Gérard P. Cachon| Kaitlin M.

However, research notes that not all experience provides equal value for performance. How, then, should surgeons accumulate experience to improve quality outcomes? In this paper, we investigate the differential effects of focal and related (i.e., tasks similar to, but not identical to, the focal task) experience. We open up the black box of the volume-outcome relationship by going beyond just dividing experience into focal and related categories, but also considering how subtasks and context (i.e., the organization in which the work takes place) affect performance. To understand these issues, we assemble a novel data set on 71 cardiothoracic surgeons who performed more than 6,500 procedures during a period of 10 years after the introduction of a breakthrough surgical procedure. We find that, as compared to related experience, surgeon focal experience has a greater effect on surgeon performance. We also demonstrate that subtask experience has different, nonlinear performance relationships for focal and related experience. Finally, we find that focal experience is more firm specific than related experience and that nonfirm experience reduces the learning rate for both focal and related experience. We discuss implications of our findings for healthcare delivery and operations management.|Diwas Singh KC| Bradley R.

Such patients tend to have higher mortality rates and longer lengths of stay than direct admissions to the ICU. As such, the medical community has invested substantial efforts in the development of patient risk scores with the intent to identify patients at risk of deterioration. In this work, we consider how one such risk score could be used to trigger proactive transfers to the ICU. We utilize a retrospective data set from 21 Kaiser Permanente Northern California hospitals to estimate the potential benefit of transferring patients to the ICU at various levels of patient risk of deterioration. To reduce the sensitivity of our findings to key identification and modeling assumptions, we use a combination of multivariate matching and instrumental variable approaches. Using our empirical results to calibrate a simulation model, we find that proactively transferring the most severe patients could reduce mortality rates and lengths of stay without increasing other adverse events; however, proactive transfers should be used judiciously, as being too aggressive could increase ICU congestion and degrade quality of care.|Wenqi Hu, |Carri W.

In this paper, we formulate a model for determining how to optimally dispatch distinguishable servers to prioritized customers given a set of equity constraints. These issues are examined through the lens of emergency medical service (EMS) dispatch, for which a Markov decision process model is developed that captures how to dispatch ambulances (servers) to prioritized patients (customers). It is assumed that customers arrive sequentially, with the priority and location of each customer becoming known upon arrival. Four types of equity constraints are considered—two of which reflect customer equity and two of which reflect server equity—all of which draw upon the decision analytic and social science literature to compare the effects of different notions of equity on the resulting dispatching policies. The Markov decision processes are formulated as equity-constrained linear programming models. A computational example is applied to an EMS system to compare the different equity models.|Laura A.

reference price"|Problem definition: Reference prices arise as price expectations against which consumers evaluate products in their purchase scenarios. We investigate what will happen when prospect theory (e.g., reference prices) meets consumer choice models from the perspectives of both the consumers and the firm. Academic/practical relevance: Consumers see multiple relevant products on a particular purchase occasion and often compare their prices to form the willingness to pay when considering whether to purchase a particular product. Reference prices, which are not included in many choice models, may impact consumer choice behavior, so we incorporate reference prices into consumer choice models and investigate the operations management problems. Methodology: We take the widely used multinomial logit model as a showcase to examine the effects of reference prices through analytical and empirical study. We consider the optimization problems on assortment planning and pricing under consumer choice models with a variety of reference prices, including the lowest price and the assortment variety. Results: Our empirical study on a real data set demonstrates that incorporating reference prices into choice models can significantly improve goodness of fit and prediction accuracy of consumer choice behavior. Moreover, we characterize the optimal policies for the assortment planning and pricing problems under the consumer choice models with various reference prices. In particular, for the pricing problems under the reference prices defined by either the lowest price or assortment variety, we show that the optimal pricing policy has the following structure: products can be divided into several groups based on their costs; the products in the same group charge either the same markup or the same price. Managerial implications: In practice, reference prices should be taken into account in model estimation and operations management. Ignoring reference prices may lead to substantial losses.|Ruxian Wang ||||||||||Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, Baltimore, Maryland 21202||||||||||USA|||||||||

The supply chain we study consists of a profit-maximizing manufacturer with a quantity-discount schedule that is nonincreasing in quantity and ensures nondecreasing revenue, a profit-maximizing GPO, a competitive source selling at a fixed unit price, and n providers (e.g., hospitals) with fixed demands for a single product. Each provider seeks to minimize its total purchasing cost (i.e., the cost of the goods plus the provider's own fixed transaction cost). Buying through the GPO offers providers possible cost reductions but may involve a membership fee. Selling through the GPO offers the manufacturer possibly higher volumes, but requires that the manufacturer pay the GPO a contract administration fee (CAF), i.e., a percentage of all revenue contracted through it. Using a game-theoretic model, we examine questions about this supply chain, including how the presence of a GPO affects the providers' total purchasing costs. We also address the controversy about whether Congress should amend the Social Security Act, which, under current law, permits CAFs. Among other things, we conclude that although CAFs affect the distribution of profits between manufacturers and GPOs, they do not affect the providers' total purchasing costs.|Qiaohai (Joice) Hu| Leroy B.

As a benchmark, we first consider the independent audit-penalty mechanism in which the buyers conduct their respective audits and impose penalties independently. We then examine the implications of two new audit-penalty mechanisms that entail a collective penalty. The first is the joint mechanism under which buyers conduct audits jointly, share the total audit cost incurred, and impose a collective penalty if the supplier fails their joint audit. The second is the shared mechanism in which each buyer conducts audits independently, shares its audit reports with the other buyers, and imposes a collective penalty if the supplier fails any one of the audits. Using a simultaneous-move game-theoretic model with two buyers and one supplier, our analysis reveals that both the joint and the shared mechanisms are beneficial in several ways. First, when the wholesale price is exogenously given, we establish the following analytical results for the joint mechanism in comparison with the independent mechanism: (a) the supplier’s compliance level is higher; (b) the supplier’s profit is lower while the buyers’ profits are higher; and (c) when the buyers’ damage cost is high, the joint audit mechanism creates supply chain value so the buyers can offer an appropriate transfer payment to make the supplier better off. Second, for the shared audit mechanism, we establish similar results but under more restrictive conditions. Finally, when the wholesale price is endogenously determined by the buyers, our numerical analysis shows that the key results continue to hold.|Felipe Caro | Prashant Chintapalli| Kumar Rajaram| Chris S.

The firm initially leases farm space, but its realized amount of fruit supply fluctuates because of weather conditions, diseases, etc. At the end of the growing season, the firm has three options: convert its crop supply to the final product, purchase additional supplies from other growers, and sell some (or all) of its crop supply in the open market without converting to the finished product. We consider the problem both from a risk-neutral and a risk-averse perspective with varying degrees of risk aversion. The paper offers three sets of contributions: (1) It shows that the use of a static cost exaggerates the initial investment in the farm space and the expected profit significantly, and the actual value gained from a secondary (emergency) option for an agricultural firm is lower under the yield-dependent cost structure. (2) It proves that although the risk-neutral firm does not benefit from fruit futures, a sufficiently risk-averse firm can benefit from the presence of a fruit futures market. The same risk-averse firm does not purchase fruit futures when it operates under static costs. Thus, fruit futures can only add value under yield-dependent trading costs. (3) Contrary to the results presented for the newsvendor problem under demand uncertainty, the firm does not always commit to a lower initial quantity (leased farm space) under risk aversion. Rather, the firm might lease a larger farm space under risk aversion.|Burak Kazaz| Scott Webster|||||||||Whitman School of Management, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York 13244|Whitman School of Management, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York 13244|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

Our findings, using data from one of the largest financial services providers in the United States, indicate that customer sensitivity to service time varies widely and predictably with observable market characteristics. In turn, we find evidence that local operating managers account for market-specific customer sensitivities to service times by deviating frequently and in predictable ways from the recommendations offered by a centralized capacity-planning model. Finally, we document that these discretionary capacity supply decisions exhibit a strong learning effect whereby experienced operating managers place more weight than their less-experienced counterparts on the market-specific trade-off between service capacity costs and customer sensitivity to service times. Overall, our results demonstrate both the importance of local knowledge as an input in service operations and the potential for incorporating richer data on customer behavior and preferences into service cost and productivity standard metrics.|Dennis Campbell| Frances Frei|||||||||Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts 02163|Harvard Business School, Boston, Massachusetts 02163|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

We break that equivalence by considering nonperishable inventory. We prove that with nonperishable inventory, the famous “stock more” result is often reversed to “stock less,” in that the Bayesian optimal inventory level with unobserved lost sales is lower than the myopic inventory level. We also prove that making lost sales unobservable increases the Bayesian optimal inventory level; in this specific sense, the famous “stock more” result of other studies generalizes to the case of nonperishable inventory.|Li Chen| Erica L.

In this paper, we consider a facility location problem in the presence of random facility disruptions where facilities can be protected with additional investments. Whereas most existing models in the literature implicitly assume that the disruption probability estimate is perfectly accurate, we investigate the impact of misestimating the disruption probability. Using a stylized continuous location model, we show that underestimation in disruption probability results in greater increase in the expected total cost than overestimation. In addition, we show that, when planned properly, the cost of mitigating the misestimation risk is not too high. Under a more generalized setting incorporating correlated disruptions and finite capacity, we numerically show that underestimation in both disruption probability and correlation degree result in greater increase in the expected total cost compared to overestimation. We, however, find that the impact of misestimating the correlation degree is much less significant relative to that of misestimating the disruption probability. Thus, managers should focus more on accurately estimating the disruption probability than the correlation.|Michael K. Lim| Achal Bassamboo| Sunil Chopra| Mark S.

Two sources of inefficiencies exist in such a supply chain: One is double marginalization and the other is externalities among retailers. Whereas double marginalization always leads to inventory understocking at the retail echelon, we find that the implications of externalities are more complex, because different externalities can improve or deteriorate supply chain performance, relative to the situation without externalities.|Serguei Netessine| Fuqiang Zhang|||||||||The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6366|Graduate School of Management, University of California, Irvine, California 92697-3125|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

We employ a multiperiod model to study the optimal one-time processing and (output) storage capacity investment decisions—in addition to the periodic processing and inventory decisions—when both input and output spot prices as well as production yield are uncertain. We characterize the optimal decisions and perform sensitivity analysis to investigate how spot price uncertainty affects the processor’s optimal capacity and profitability. Using a calibration based on the palm industry, we study (both numerically and analytically) the performance of a variety of heuristic capacity investment policies that can be used in practice. We find that if the yield uncertainty is ignored in capacity planning, then basing those plans on the average yield is preferable to basing them (as often occurs in practice) on the maximum yield. However, planning based on the average yield performs well only when the relative (processing-to-storage) capacity investment cost is high; otherwise, it leads to a significant loss of profit. We also find that ignoring spot price uncertainty in capacity planning results in a relatively small profit loss. In contrast, ignoring by-product revenue—which constitutes a small portion of total revenues—during capacity planning substantially reduces the processor’s profit.|Onur Boyabatlı | Jason Nguyen| Tong Wang||||||||Lee Kong Chian School of Business, Singapore Management University, Singapore 178899|Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455|NUS Business School, National University of Singapore, Singapore 119245||||||||SINGAPORE|USA|SINGAPORE|||||||

The general premise behind these works is that such models may be used to help manage an ED that consistently faces high congestion. In this work, we propose a class of proactive policies that utilize future information of potential patient arrivals to effectively manage admissions into an ED while reducing waiting times for patients who are eventually treated. Instead of the standard strategy of waiting for queues to build before diverting patients, the proposed policy utilizes the predictions to identify when congestion is going to increase and proactively diverts patients before things get “too bad.” We demonstrate that the proposed policy provides delay improvements over standard policies used in practice. We also consider the impact of errors in the information provided by the predictive models and find that even with noisy predictions, our proposed policies can still outperform (achieving shorter delays while serving the same number of patients) standard diversion policies. If the quality of the predictive model is insufficient, then it is better to ignore the future information and simply rely on real-time, current information for the basis of decision making. Using simulation, we find that our proposed policy can reduce delays by up to 15%.|Kuang Xu| Carri W.

We assume that the available production capacity is limited and that unmet demand is lost. We incorporate discretionary sales, when inventory may be set aside to satisfy future demand even if some present demand is lost. We analyze and compare partial planning or delayed strategies. In delayed strategies, one decision may be planned in advance, whereas a second decision is delayed until the beginning of each time period, after observing the results of previous decisions. For example, in delayed production (delayed pricing), pricing (production) is determined at the beginning of the horizon, and the production (pricing) decision is made at the beginning of each period before new customer orders are received. A special case is where a single price is chosen over the horizon. We describe policies and heuristics for the strategies based on deterministic approximations and analyze their performances. Computational analysis yields additional insights about the strategies, such as that delayed production is usually better than delayed pricing except sometimes when capacity is tight. On average, the delayed production (pricing) heuristic achieved 99.3% (99.8%) of the corresponding optimal strategy.|Lap Mui Ann Chan| David Simchi-Levi| Julie Swann||||||||Grado Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, 250 Durham Hall, Blacksburg, Virginia 24061-0118|Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering and the Engineering Systems Division, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 77 Massachusetts Avenue, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139|School of Industrial and Systems Engineering, Georgia Institute of Technology, 755 Ferst Drive, Atlanta, Georgia 30332-0205||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

We use the analytical expressions to numerically study the effect of system parameters on system performance.

We characterize each firm's investment in mass customization and study its dependence on competitive position, as determined by its cost efficiency and perceived quality vis-à-vis its competitor. We find that the value of mass customization critically depends on the firm's competitive position. It may not be desirable even at zero cost due to its negative effect on price competition. A firm with an overall cost and quality disadvantage never unilaterally adopts mass customization. We show that allowing firms to set different prices for each product configuration leads to a broader adoption of mass customization compared to when they are restricted to uniform prices. However, a firm's chosen customization level may be higher with uniform prices. Our analysis also helps a customizing firm determine whether to target its process improvement efforts for a lower cost or a higher customization level.|Haim Mendelson| Ali K.

The first one requires setting an inventory target for each product, and the second requires dynamically allocating the scarce capacity among the products. It is not known how to make these decisions optimally. In this paper, we propose easily implementable policies that have both theoretical and practical appeal. We first suggest simple and intuitive allocation rules that determine how such scarce capacity is shared. Given such rules, we calculate the optimal inventory target for each product. We demonstrate analytically that our policies are optimal under two asymptotic regimes represented by high service levels (i.e., high shortage costs) and heavy traffic (i.e., tight capacity). We also demonstrate that our policies outperform current known policies over a wide range of problem parameters. In particular, the cost savings from our policies become more significant as the capacity gets more restrictive.|Ganesh Janakiraman | Mahesh Nagarajan | Senthil Veeraraghavan ||||||||Naveen Jindal School of Management, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75080|Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia V6T 1Z2, Canada|The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

The firm optimizes both its capacity investment under demand uncertainty and its sourcing of funds from a competitive investor. Ours is the first study of this problem to adopt an optimal contracting approach: feasible sources of funds are derived endogenously from fundamentals and include standard financial claims (debt, equity, convertible debt, etc.). Thus, in contrast to most of the literature on financing capacity investments, our results are robust to a change of financial contract. We characterize the optimal capacity level under optimal financing. First, we find conditions under which a feasible financial contract exists that leads to the first-best capacity. When no such contract exists, we find that under optimal financing, the choice of capacity sometimes exceeds strictly the efficient level. Furthermore, the firm invests more when its cash is low, and in some cases less when the project’s unit revenue is high. These results run counter to the newsvendor logic and standard finance arguments. We also show that our main results hold in the case of a strategic monopolist investor, and such an investor may invest more then a competitive one.|Francis de Véricourt | Denis Gromb |||||||||European School of Management and Technology, 10178 Berlin, Germany|HEC Paris, 78350 Jouy-en-Josas, France|||||||||GERMANY|FRANCE||||||||

Order crossovers require that optimal reorder levels be set with regard to the inventory shortfall distribution rather than the lead-time demand distribution. Assuming periodic review and independent lead times, this paper suggests simple approximations of the shortfall distribution by showing that the variance of the number of orders outstanding is bounded above by the standard deviation of lead time divided by √3. Using this bound in a normal approximation improves significantly upon the common practice of basing policies on the lead-time demand distribution. A negative binomial approximation of the shortfall, based on its exact variance, offers even greater improvement, at the cost of some additional informational and computational requirements.|James R.

By routinely scrutinizing nonprofit reports in an effort to deduce whether a nonprofit organization is efficient, funders may believe that they are, in fact, giving responsibly. However, we find that these nonprofit reports are unreliable, supporting a myriad of empirical research and revealing that report-based funding methods do not facilitate efficient allocation of funds. In response, we develop audit contracts that put funders in a position to enact change. Auditing, perhaps obviously, supports funders; however, we find that it also benefits the population of nonprofits. Moreover, auditing results in improved efficiency for the nonprofit sector overall. Indeed, our conclusions indicate that nonprofits may want to work with funders to increase the use of auditing, consequently increasing efficiency for the sector overall and impacting society as a whole.|Natalie Privett| Feryal Erhun|||||||||Department of Management Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305|Department of Management Science and Engineering, College of Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

In this paper we consider the dynamic risk management problem for a commodity processor operating in a partially complete market, facing both price uncertainty and significant financial distress costs. The firm procures an input commodity, processes it to produce an output commodity, and trades the output commodity in each period over a multiperiod horizon. The firm’s objective is to dynamically and jointly plan operational and financial hedging decisions to maximize the market-based value of cash flows under a time-consistent risk measure. We show that the optimal operational policy has the same price and horizon dependent threshold structure that obtains when markets are complete. We also characterize conditions under which a myopic policy is optimal. We present numerical studies to illustrate that (i) compared to using a myopic policy or a policy that neglects to model financial distress costs, the advantage of using the optimal policy is significant for firms that face moderate financial distress costs and have excess procurement capacity; (ii) more acute financial distress costs reduce the firm’s market-based value and throughput; and (iii) financial hedging provides considerable benefit by reducing the incidence of large negative cash flows.|Sripad K.

We compare a model where the retailer selects the assortment in the category with a model where the retailer relies on a category captain for assortment decisions in return for a target category profit.

Our empirical analysis of 82,235 customers exploits the varying competitive dynamics in 644 geographically isolated markets in which a nationwide retail bank conducted business over a five-year period. We find that customers defect at a higher rate from the incumbent following increased service quality (price) competition only when the incumbent offers high (low) quality service relative to existing competitors in a local market. We provide evidence that these results are due to a sorting effect, whereby firms trade off service quality and price, and, in turn, the incumbent attracts service (price) sensitive customers in markets where it has supplied relatively high (low) levels of service quality in the past. Furthermore, we show that it is the high quality incumbent’s most profitable customers who are the most attracted by superior quality alternatives. Our results appear to have long-run implications whereby sustaining a high level of service quality is associated with the incumbent attracting and retaining more profitable customers over time.|Ryan W.

Although the leader and the follower cooperate in their component purchase, they compete in selling their end products. We first analyze the most common and simple form of LCB, equal price LCB, under which the follower pays to the leader the same wholesale price that the leader obtains from his negotiation with the supplier. We compare each buyer’s profit under the equal price LCB with the benchmark where each buyer purchases separately from the supplier. We find that although the alliance might obtain a lower wholesale price and although the leader is always better off under equal price LCB, the follower can be worse off if the competition intensity of the leader’s and follower’s products is within an intermediate region. We identify a competition effect resulting from equal price LCB that can place the follower at a disadvantage in the competition. This finding implies that the equal price LCB might not be sustainable in practice. In view of this limitation, we investigate an alternative form of LCB, fixed price LCB, under which the follower pays a fixed price to the leader regardless of the wholesale price the leader obtains from the supplier. We show that fixed price LCB benefits not only the leader but also the follower, compared with separate purchases, which implies that fixed price LCB always achieves a win–win outcome for the buyers.

In theory, a number of different contracts can solve this issue and induce first-best investment levels by the supplier. In this study, we investigate the performance of these contracts in a two-tier supply chain. We develop an experimental design where retailers and suppliers bargain over contract terms—and have the ability to make multiple back-and-forth offers—while also providing feedback on the offers they receive. One key result from our study is that an option contract and a service-level agreement are best at increasing first-best investment levels and overall supply chain profits. However, these same contracts also generate the largest inequity in expected profits between the two parties. We find that both of these results are driven by the bargaining tendencies of retailers and suppliers, which we refer to as “superficial fairness.” In particular, retailers and suppliers place more emphasis on negotiating the wholesale price, while partially overlooking any secondary parameter, such that final wholesale prices end up roughly halfway between the retailer’s selling price and the supplier’s production cost. We show that this bargaining behavior contributes to higher investment levels observed in the option contract and service-level agreement, along with the inequitable payoffs.|Andrew M.

Refurbishing to remarket or to fulfill warranty claims are the two common disposition options considered to unlock the value in consumer returns, which present the OEM with a challenging problem: How should an OEM dynamically allocate consumer returns between fulfilling warranty claims and remarketing refurbished products over the product’s life cycle? We analyze this dynamic allocation problem and find that when warranty claims and consumer returns are jointly taken into account, the remarketing option is generally dominated by the option of refurbishing and earmarking consumer returns to fulfill warranty claims. Over the product’s life cycle, the OEM should strategically emphasize earmarking of consumer returns at the early stages of the life cycle to build up earmarked inventory for the future warranty demand, whereas it should consider remarketing at the later stages of the life cycle after enough earmarked inventory is accumulated or most of the warranty demand uncertainty is resolved. These findings show that, for product categories with significant warranty coverage and refund costs, remarketing may not be the most profitable disposition option even if the product has strong remarketing potential and the OEM has the pricing leverage to tap into this market. We also show that the optimal dynamic disposition policy is a price-dependent base-stock policy where the earmarked quantity is capacitated by the new and refurbished product sales quantities. We compare with the myopic policy and show that it is a good heuristic for the optimal dynamic disposition policy.|Çerağ Pinçe| Mark Ferguson| Beril Toktay||||||||Çerağ Pinçe|Moore School of Business, University of South Carolina, Columbia, South Carolina 29208|Scheller College of Business, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 31200||||||||GERMANY|USA|USA|||||||

However, there are recent cases in which the manufacturer imposes “delayed payment” contracts under which each supplier is paid only when all suppliers have completed their tasks. By considering a model of one manufacturer and n ≥ 2 identical and independent suppliers with exponential completion times, we analyze the impact of both a delayed payment regime and a no-delayed-payment regime on each supplier's effort level and on the manufacturer's net profit in equilibrium. When the suppliers' work rates are unadjustable, we conjecture that the manufacturer is actually worse off under the delayed payment regime. However, when the suppliers' work rates are adjustable, we obtain a different result: the delayed payment regime is more profitable for the manufacturer either when the project revenue is sufficiently small or when the number of suppliers is sufficiently large.|H.

Less well understood is the tradeoff between the increased ability to precisely meet customer preferences and the increased leadtime from order placement to delivery often associated with customized products. In this paper, we use a locational customer choice model to formulate a firm's integrated product line design problem that involves variety, leadtime (or inventory), and pricing decisions. We propose a dynamic programming based solution procedure that amounts to solving a shortest path problem on an acyclic network, and derive some structural results on the optimal product line design. We find that unimodal preferences generally result in hybrid product lines, with standard products clustering around the mode and custom products covering the tails, in contrast with the all-custom or all-standard product lines that are optimal under uniform preferences. We also numerically examine how the firm should adjust its leadtime and variety in response to changes in parameters such as customer dispersion and operational scale.

In general, a smooth demand process facilitates production/inventory planning. Therefore, it is beneficial for a firm to induce its salespeople to exert effort in a way that actually smoothes the demand process.

It evaluates and compensates the sales force on a moving-time-window basis, where the length of the time window is determined by the production lead time. Numerical examples show that the proposed package is beneficial to the firm relative to a widely used compensation plan based on annual quotas.|Fangruo Chen||||||||||Graduate School of Business, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027||||||||||USA|||||||||

Carbon footprinting typically aims to identify where best to invest in emission reduction efforts, and/or to determine the proportion of total emissions that an individual firm is accountable for, whether financially and/or operationally. A major and underrecognized challenge in determining the appropriate allocation stems from the high degree to which GHG emissions are the result of joint efforts by multiple firms. We introduce a simple but general model of joint production of GHG emissions in general supply chains, decomposing the total footprint into processes, each of which can be influenced by any combination of firms. We analyze two main scenarios. In the first scenario, the social planner allocates emissions to individual firms and imposes a cost on them (such as a carbon tax) in proportion to the emissions allocated. In the second scenario, a carbon leader voluntarily agrees to offset all emissions in the entire supply chain and then contracts with individual firms to recoup (part of) the costs of those offsets. In both cases, we find that, to induce the optimal effort levels, the emissions need to be overallocated, even if the carbon tax is the true social cost of carbon. This is in contrast to the usual focus in the life-cycle assessment (LCA) and carbon footprinting literatures on avoiding double counting. Our work aims to lay the foundation for a framework to integrate the economics- and LCA-based perspectives on supply chain carbon footprinting.|Felipe Caro| Charles J.

The consumers are heterogeneous in their evaluations of quality, and strategic in that they decide not only whether and which product variant to buy, but also when to buy, choosing the option that maximizes their utility. We derive the equilibrium of the pricing-purchasing game between the firm and the consumers. We find that the loss due to strategic customer behavior can be less with two product variants compared to the single-product benchmark, which indicates that product variety can serve as a lever when dealing with strategic customers. This benefit exists when the additional product has an inferior cost-to-quality ratio. Because of this benefit, a firm may find it attractive to sell a product variant that would be unprofitable otherwise. However, product variety can also hurt profitability due to strategic customer behavior: A product variant that would be profitable absent strategic customers can in fact be unprofitable. This can happen when customer impatience and firm costs are moderate.|Ali K.

replenishment"|We develop an automated teller machine (ATM) replenishment policy for a bank that operates multiple ATMs. The aim is to minimize the cost of replenishments and stockouts, taking into account the economies of scale involved in replenishing multiple ATMs simultaneously. When the replenishment is outsourced to an outside vendor, the replenishment cost is typically additive. However, when it is done by in-house operations, the replenishment cost is a submodular function of the set of ATMs being replenished. The additive replenishment cost function yields a tractable and separable inventory management problem. However, the submodular cost function creates a much harder problem. We construct a Markov decision process model and study the structure of the optimal strategy that minimizes the long-run average cost. Since the optimal policy is analytically and computationally intractable for the case of a large number of ATMs, we study a heuristic policy (called the index policy) in the case of submodular replenishment costs. We find that the index policy performs close to the optimal policy (when it can be computed) and performs much better than the benchmark (namely, an (s, M) policy) in general. We demonstrate similar findings in a real-world data set with 139 ATMs and 20 months of historical demand data. Finally, we recommend that the bank managers use the index policy to design a replenishment schedule.|Yu Zhang | Vidyadhar Kulkarni|||||||||University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599|University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

The retailer has a single opportunity to order a product from the supplier to satisfy future uncertain demand. Both the retailer and supplier are capital constrained, and the retailer can use both short-term bank loans and trade credits for his financing needs, while the supplier can use short-term bank loans and/or the retailers early payment. We analyze for all relevant operational decisions (wholesale price, trade credit rates, bank loans, and order quantity) for capital-constrained firms. Academic/practical relevance: We add a framework on who should finance inventories, and at what rates, in the presence of differential credit ratings of the supply chain parties. Methodology: Within a modified selling to the newsvendor Stackelberg game with the supplier as the leader, we derive the equilibrium trade credit rates, wholesale price, bank loans, and order quantity. Results: We show there exists a threshold such that if the supplier’s credit rating is above it, then the supplier offers trade credits with zero interest rate and the retailer uses trade credits only. Otherwise, the supplier sets a positive rate, which motivates the retailer to combine trade credits and bank loans. The supplier always benefits from working with good rating retailers. A retailer prefers to work with suppliers outside the supplier’s credit rating hole (a finite set of ratings) over suppliers with ratings within the range. Managerial implications: We provide insights on who should finance supply chain inventories and at what rates when there are differential credit rating between the supplier and retailer. We provide a plausible explanation for the practice of large and good credit rating retailers maintaining a small cash ratio and working with small suppliers in developing countries.|Panos Kouvelis | Wenhui Zhao |||||||||Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130|Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200030, China|||||||||USA|CHINA||||||||

The buyer procures a product from a supplier and then sells to the marketplace. Market demand is stochastic and depends on the buyer's selling price. The supplier's production cost is private information, and the buyer only knows the distribution of the cost. Both the buyer and the supplier can hold inventories to improve service, and a periodic-review inventory system is considered. The buyer takes two attributes into consideration when designing the procurement mechanism: quantity attribute (i.e., the total purchase quantity) and service-level attribute (i.e., the supplier's delivery performance). We first identify the optimal procurement mechanism for the buyer, which consists of a nonlinear menu of contracts for each of the two attributes. It can be shown that the optimal mechanism induces both a lower market demand and a lower service level compared to the supply chain optimum. In view of the complexity of the optimal mechanism, we proceed to search for simpler mechanisms that perform well for the buyer. We find that the above two attributes have different implications for procurement mechanism design: The value of using complex contract terms is generally negligible for the service-level attribute, whereas it can be highly valuable for the quantity attribute. In particular, we demonstrate that a fixed service-level contract, which consists of a target service level and a price-quantity menu, yields nearly optimal profit for the buyer. Additionally, the price-quantity menu is essentially a quantity discount scheme widely observed in practice.|Fuqiang Zhang||||||||||Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130||||||||||USA|||||||||

We assume consumer-driven, dynamic, stockout-based substitution and random proportions of each type. No efficient method to obtain the optimal solution for this problem is known to our knowledge. However, if the number of customers of each type is a fixed proportion of demand, there exists an efficient algorithm for solving for the optimal assortment. We show that the fixed proportions model gives an upper bound to the optimal expected profit for the random proportions model. This bound allows us to obtain a measure of the absolute performance of heuristic solutions. We also provide a bound for the component-wise absolute difference in expected sales between the two models, which is asymptotically tight as the inventory vector is made large, while keeping the number of products fixed. This result provides us with a lower bound to the optimal expected profit and a performance guarantee for the fixed proportions solution in the random proportions model.|Dorothée Honhon| Sridhar Seshadri|||||||||Operations Planning Accounting and Control, School of Industrial Engineering, Eindhoven University of Technology, 5612 AZ Eindhoven, The Netherlands|Department of Information, Risk, and Operations Management, McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712|||||||||NETHERLANDS|USA||||||||

Using empirical data from multiple stores of a consumer electronics retailer, Tweeter Home Entertainment Group, we highlight the extent to which store manager incentive design impacts store manager behavior and, consequently, retail performance. More specifically, we describe the shift in store manager behavior resulting from a change in incentives, which, in part, altered the importance of sales relative to inventory shrinkage in the store manager compensation plan. Store managers, following this change, directed less attention to the prevention of inventory shrinkage and more toward sales-generating activities and made different process choices within the store. We observed increases in the level of inventory shrinkage and sales within these stores. Controlling for alternative drivers of sales and inventory shrinkage, we find this change in incentive design to be associated with a profit improvement of 4.2% of sales. This work indicates that altering how store managers are compensated impacts retail performance. Moreover, our findings underscore the importance of balancing the rewards given for different types of activities in contexts where agents face multiple competing tasks.|Nicole DeHoratius| Ananth Raman|||||||||Graduate School of Business, University of Chicago, 5807 South Woodlawn Avenue, Chicago, Illinois 60637|Harvard Business School, Morgan Hall, Soldiers Field, Boston, Massachusetts 02163|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

Renewable technology has a higher investment cost and yields only an intermittent supply of electricity; nonrenewable technology is reliable and has lower investment cost but entails both fuel expenditures and carbon emission costs. With reference to existing electricity markets, we model several interrelated contexts—the vertically integrated electricity supplier, market competition, and partial market competition with long-term fixed-price contracts for renewable electricity—and examine the effect of carbon taxes on the cost and share of wind capacity in an energy portfolio. We find that the intermittency of renewable technologies drives the effectiveness of carbon pricing mechanisms, which suggests that charging more for emissions could unexpectedly discourage investment in renewables. We also show that market liberalization may reduce investment in renewable capacity while increasing the overall system’s cost and emissions. Fixed-price contracts with renewable generators can mitigate these detrimental effects, but not without possibly creating other problems. In short, actions to reduce the intermittency of renewable sources may be more effective than carbon taxes alone at promoting investment in renewable generation capacity.|Sam Aflaki| Serguei Netessine|||||||||Information Systems and Operations Management Area, HEC Paris, 78350 Jouy-en-Josas, France|Technology and Operations Management Area, INSEAD, 77300 Fontainebleau, France|||||||||FRANCE|FRANCE||||||||

However, laboratory experiments show a “pull-to-center” effect: average order quantities are too low when they should be high and vice versa. We replicate this pull-to-center effect in laboratory experiments and construct an adaptive learning model that incorporates memory, reinforcement, and probabilistic choice to explain individual decisions. The intuition underlying the model's prediction is that the most recent demand observation is more likely to have been greater than the optimal order quantity if the optimal order quantity is low, in which case a recency bias tends to pull the order quantity upward. A countervailing downward pull exists if the optimal order quantity is high. The recency effect may be augmented by a reinforcement bias, which causes subjects to focus more on the profitability of decisions they actually make and less on counterfactual payoffs that would have resulted from other order quantities. The predictions of this model track the observed data patterns across treatments. A pull-to-center pattern is also observed in designs involving doubled payoffs and reduced order frequency.|AJ A.

In each order cycle, retailers place their orders at the supplier to minimize inventory-related expected costs at the end of their respective response times. There are two types of lead times involved. At the end of the supplier lead time, retailers are given an opportunity to readjust their initial orders (without changing the total order size), so that both retailers can improve their expected costs at the end of respective retailer lead times (the time it takes for items to be shipped from the supplier to the retailers). Because of the possibility of cooperation at the end of supplier lead time, each retailer will consider the other’s order-up-to level in making the ordering decision. Under mild conditions, we prove the existence of a unique Nash equilibrium for the retailer order-up-to levels, and show that they can be obtained by solving a set of newsboy-like equations.

We consider the case in which the order of jobs within the family is unconstrained, and a variation in which the order is fixed. The optimization is with respect to the weighted flowtime, and we treat problems both with and without a makespan-constraint. Practical examples based on this model are described. We partially characterize an optimal policy by means of a Gittins rewardrate index and a similar switching index derived from multi-armed bandit theory. For deterministic problems with a makespan constraint, we present an optimization algorithm for the special case of two families and at most three set-ups .

In a congested facility, such a situation would be impossible using conventional queuing logic. We propose a conceptual model of a firm in which workers make schedule by rushing jobs, if necessary, with potential quality consequences. Hence, time and quality are substitutes, a feature that we recognize explicitly in our definition of the firm's capacity. Production yields are not exogenous parameters but endogenously determined by workers responding to schedule pressures. The plant manager can authorize overtime to relieve this pressure or live with the quality consequences of rushing. The model reveals the close relationships among the firm's workforce policies, the integrity of the inspection system, and the cost performance of the firmas its volume and/or product line expands. We consider pure congestion (driven by volume) and pure complexity (driven by product line breadth) effects in the context of our plant performance model. We consider two root causes of complexity costs: time and quality. The time effects of complexity will only have cost consequences in congested facilities, but quality effects are always present. Also in contrast to time effects, quality effects of complexity can be present in nonbottleneck workstations.

This paper proposes a framework for service differentiation that highlights the identification and use of operating segments as a central component in the delivery of differentiated services. The notion of operating segments and the general empirical methodology to identify them proposed in this paper integrally considers the consumer’s preferences and operational capabilities required to fulfill the differentiated service offering. An application in the context of after-sales services for product-service bundles using data from a major manufacturer in the consumer electronics industry is presented, which illustrates how operational decisions need to be adjusted when multiple operating segments are defined to support a service differentiation strategy.|Jose A.

Using an analytical model that focuses on a multiplicative demand form, we generalize previous results and produce new structural insights. A novel transformation technique first enables us to establish the unimodality of the profit functions for both channel partners, under relatively mild assumptions. Further analysis identifies the necessary and sufficient condition under which the optimal contract for the manufacturer (wholesale and buyback prices) is distribution free, i.e., independent of the uncertainty in customer demand. A specific instance of the above condition is also necessary and sufficient for a no-buyback contract to be optimal from the manufacturer's perspective. We then prove that the optimal performance of the decentralized channel for distribution-free buyback contracts depends only on the curvature of the deterministic demand part. In addition, some of the optimal decisions and relevant profit ratios for buyback contracts in our setting are shown to be identical to those for their deterministic price-only counterparts.|Yuyue Song| Saibal Ray| Shanling Li||||||||Faculty of Business Administration, Memorial University of Newfoundland, St. John's, Newfoundland A1B 3X5, Canada|Desautels Faculty of Management, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec H3A 1G5, Canada|Desautels Faculty of Management, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec H3A 1G5, Canada||||||||CANADA|CANADA|CANADA|||||||

Customers who invest in these products may, however, react adversely to rapid improvements that make their previous versions obsolete by deferring their purchase. In industrial markets, there is an emerging trend of sequentially improving products designed to be upgraded in a modular fashion. We study the impact of product architecture and introduction timing on the launch of rapidly improving products. We find that by localizing performance improvements in a sequence of upgradable modules of the product, a firm can better manage the introduction of rapidly improving products. Specifically, we show that modular upgradability can reduce the need for slowing the pace of innovation or forgoing upgrade pricing. The additional flexibility in pricing and timing makes the modular, upgradable approach preferable to an integrated architecture, even in some situations where there may be distinct performance or cost-related disadvantages to pursuing the modular architecture. We differentiate between proprietary and nonproprietary approaches to modular upgradability and consider the implications for profits. Our central contribution in this paper is the innovative integration of product architecture with pricing and timing decisions for managing the introduction of rapidly improving products.|Karthik Ramachandran| V.

The workload is the number of operating room hours used by a medical specialty on a given day to perform surgical procedures. Variable costs consist of wages at a regular (scheduled) rate and at an overtime rate when the realized workload exceeds the scheduled time. Using a newsvendor framework, we consider the problem of determining optimal staffing levels with different information sets available at the time of decision: no information, information on number of cases, and information on number and types of cases. We develop empirical models for the daily workload distribution in which the mean and variance change with the information available. We use these models to derive optimal staffing rules based on historical data from a U.S. teaching hospital and prospectively test the performance of these rules. Our numerical results suggest that hospitals could potentially reduce their staffing costs by up to 39%–49% by deferring staffing decisions until procedure type information is available. The results demonstrate how data availability can affect a newsvendor's performance.

When orders from the retailers exceed the supplier's capacity, she must employ an allocation mechanism to balance supply and demand. In particular, we consider a commonly used allocation scheme in the automobile industry: turn-and-earn, which uses past sales to allocate capacity. In essence, retailers “earn” an allotment of a vehicle after they sell one. In contrast to turn-and-earn, fixed allocation ignores past sales and gives each retailer an equal share of the capacity. Earlier work has demonstrated that turn-and-earn induces more sales in a two-period setting compared to fixed allocation. The question remains unanswered whether turn-and-earn induces similar behaviors over a long horizon when retailers possess private demand information. We construct a dynamic stochastic game of order competition over an infinite horizon to track the order dynamics of the supply chain. We obtain a richer set of equilibrium behaviors than existing models predict. Instead of a symmetric allocation outcome, we observe that sales leadership may arise in equilibrium and that retailers with different past sales adopt distinct ordering strategies to respond to demand uncertainty. Transient sales dynamics suggest that sales leadership may not be persistent and can be eliminated by the occurrence of extremely low demand. This provides a theoretical explanation for several behavioral observations of some U.S. automobile dealers. In addition to the sales-inducing effect, interestingly, turn-and-earn also causes the retailers to absorb local demand variability.|Lauren Xiaoyuan Lu| Martin A.

We apply it to the problem of replenishing inventory to subsets of products/locations, such as in the distribution of industrial gases, so as to minimize long-run time average replenishment costs. Given a marginal value for each product/location, whenever there is a stockout the dispatcher compares the total value of each feasible replenishment with its cost, and chooses one that maximizes the surplus. We derive this operating policy using a linear functional approximation to the optimal value function of a semi-Markov decision process on continuous spaces. This approximation also leads to a math program whose optimal dual prices yield values and whose optimal objective value gives a lower bound on system performance. We use duality theory to show that optimal prices satisfy several structural properties and can be interpreted as estimates of lowest achievable marginal costs. On real-world instances, the price-directed policy achieves superior, near optimal performance as compared with other approaches.|Daniel Adelman||||||||||The University of Chicago, Graduate School of Business, 1101 East 58th Street, Chicago, Illinois 60637||||||||||USA|||||||||

Both production and transportation times are stochastic with general distributions. Demand arrives at each DC according to an independent Poisson process and is backlogged if the DC is out of stock. We allow different holding and backlog costs at the different DCs. We assume that inventory at DCs is managed using the one-for-one replenishment policy. The main objective of this paper is to investigate the control of the multiechelon M/G/1 setting with general transportation times. To achieve this objective, we analyze several decentralized allocation policies including the first-come, first-served (FCFS), strict priority (SP), and multilevel rationing (MR) policies. For our analytic results, we assume no order crossing. We derive the cost function for a capacitated two-echelon inventory system with general transportation times under these policies. Our numerical examples show that the FCFS policy may outperform the MR policy, even though the latter has been shown to be better in the centralized setting. This suggests that in decentralized settings there is a need to focus on policies that prioritize customers when there is backlog. This focus is in contrast to the centralized settings, where inventory rationing policies that focus on prioritization when there is available inventory are effective. We therefore introduce and analyze the generalized multilevel rationing (GMR) priority policy. We compare the GMR policy with other policies and show that the GMR policy outperforms the three policies used in the centralized setting. We also compare the GMR policy with the myopic (T), longest queue first (LQF), and the optimal (when order crossing is allowed during the transportation time) policies. Our results show that when the uncertainty of the transportation times is low, the GMR policy outperforms the myopic (T) and LQF policies and that the gap between the optimal policy and the GMR policy is not high.|Hossein Abouee-Mehrizi| Opher Baron| Oded Berman||||||||Department of Management Sciences, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario N2L 3G1, Canada|Joseph L.

Existing research has shown empirically that fair process enhances both employee motivation and performance in execution. However, work to date has not addressed why fair process is so often violated in practice. This paper breaks new ground by analytically examining the subtle trade-offs involved. We develop a model of fair process in a principal-agent (i.e., manager-employee) context, rooted in psychological preferences for autonomy and fairness.

The firm has two operationally independent production facilities, each of which makes two products, and a cash reserve that finances all operations and dividend issuance. Each period the firm chooses the amount of dividend to issue, and at each facility it chooses production quantities and amounts of capacity to augment or divest. Relevant market data are exogenous and evolve stochastically. We completely characterize the optimal policy and the endogenous values of the capacities and cash reserve, and show that they invite a real-option interpretation. We find that internal financing creates a spillover between the endogenous values of the two operationally independent facilities, and we specify how this leads to interdependence of their optimal policies. We show that an “invest/stay put/divest” (ISD) policy remains optimal for partially irreversible investments, but internal financing changes the ISD thresholds. If the exogenous data are intertemporally independent, an internally financed firm is less likely to issue dividends or to expand capacity than if it were in a perfect capital market. As the market becomes more volatile, the endogenous values of capacities and cash increase, and the firm becomes more reluctant to issue dividends.|Jie Ning | Matthew J.

We consider four practically motivated special cases of this model, namely, the one-way substitution, the locational choice, the outtree, and the intree preference models, and we study the retailer's product selection problem when products have different price and cost parameters. We assume that the retailer incurs a fixed carrying cost per product offered, a goodwill penalty for each customer who does not purchase his first choice and a lost sale penalty for each customer who does not find an acceptable product to buy. For the first three models, we obtain efficient solution methods that simplify to either a shortest path method or a dynamic program.

Rue La La is in the online fashion sample sales industry, where they offer extremely limited-time discounts on designer apparel and accessories. One of the retailer’s main challenges is pricing and predicting demand for products that it has never sold before, which account for the majority of sales and revenue. To tackle this challenge, we use machine learning techniques to estimate historical lost sales and predict future demand of new products. The nonparametric structure of our demand prediction model, along with the dependence of a product’s demand on the price of competing products, pose new challenges on translating the demand forecasts into a pricing policy. We develop an algorithm to efficiently solve the subsequent multiproduct price optimization that incorporates reference price effects, and we create and implement this algorithm into a pricing decision support tool for Rue La La’s daily use. We conduct a field experiment and find that sales does not decrease because of implementing tool recommended price increases for medium and high price point products.

The procurement lead times of the components are random. Moreover, although the order for the finished product has a defined due date, the contract allows the customer to change the order quantity. Consequently, the assembler also faces a random demand. The assembler must determine how much to order and when to order each component part. The objective is to minimize the total expected cost, including the cost of holding components prior to their assembly, penalties for tardiness visa-vis the assembly due date, and overage and underage costs in satisfying the demand quantity.

Information resolves two types of uncertainty: product value uncertainty (i.e., consumers realize valuations when they inspect the product in store, but may end up returning the product when they purchase online) and availability uncertainty (i.e., store visits are futile when consumers encounter stockouts). We consider three information mechanisms: physical showrooms allow consumers to learn valuations anytime they visit the store, even during stockouts; virtual showrooms give consumers online access to an imperfect signal of their valuations; availability information provides real-time information about whether the store has a product in stock. Our main results follow. First, physical showrooms may prompt retailers to reduce store inventory, which increases availability risk and discourages store patronage. Second, virtual showrooms may increase online returns and hurt profits, if they induce excessive customer migration from store to online channels. Third, availability information may be redundant when availability risk is low and may render physical showrooms ineffective when implemented jointly. Finally, when customers are homogeneous, these mechanisms may not exhibit significant complementarities and the optimal information structure may involve choosing only one of the three.|Fei Gao| Xuanming Su|||||||||The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19104|The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, 19104|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

We show that BPS creates an operational synergy between two products that are jointly produced. In essence, BPS is a process innovation that reduces the marginal cost of the original product and/or the by-product. The firm creates value through this process innovation and can capture this value by capturing newly created market opportunities, taking market share from competitors, or licensing the innovation to its competitors. We determine the optimal operating and licensing strategies for the firm and find market conditions under which the firm would benefit most from implementing BPS. We show that the optimal operating and licensing strategies are driven by the size of the cost reduction enabled by the BPS process innovation. We also show that leveraging the synergies between the original product and by-product can lead to counterintuitive profit-maximizing operating strategies such as increasing the amount of waste generated, and strategically increasing the quantity of original product above the business as usual production volume. We present a framework for assessing the environmental impact of BPS that incorporates the impact of the optimal operating and licensing strategies.|Deishin Lee||||||||||Harvard Business School, Harvard University, Boston, Massachusetts 02163||||||||||USA|||||||||

Specifically, it was found that reduction in mean setup times without any change in variance can, paradoxically, increase waiting time and work in process (WIP) in a cyclic production system. Setup time variance was demonstrated to play a central role because of the paradoxes it produced with the resulting harm to effective capacity. Subsequently, explicit formulas were derived for determining whether adding fixed forced idle time (but holding variance constant) would reduce waiting time and, if so, the optimal amount of idle time to add. However, research to date has offered little guidance to reduce setup time variance to improve waiting time. We show that a greater reduction is achievable by adding a variable idle time that is a nonincreasing function of setup time and thereby reduce the combined setup time variance. We provide explicit procedures for finding the optimal variable idle time as a function of setup time when the latter follows any finite discrete distribution. We also show how to implement our policy and show that our approach can improve waiting time even when other currently known approaches cannot.|Subhashish Samaddar| Thomas Whalen|||||||||Decision Sciences and Operations Management, Department of Managerial Sciences, J.

Because the choice of vehicle mix affects how ambulances are dispatched to incoming calls, as well as how they are deployed to base locations, we adopt an optimization-based approach. We construct two models—one a Markov decision process, the other an integer program—to study the problems of dispatching and deployment in a tiered system, respectively. In each case, the objective function value attained by an optimal decision serves as our performance measure. Numerical experiments performed with both models suggest that, under reasonable choices of inputs, a wide range of tiered systems perform comparably to all-ALS fleets.|Kenneth C. Chong| Shane G.

Although previous studies have tried to explain the underinvestment, we focus on how the way in which a portfolio of opportunities is presented in a list affects adoption decisions. We use information on over 100,000 energy-saving recommendations made to more than 13,000 small and medium-sized manufacturing firms under the Industrial Assessment Centers program of the U.S. Department of Energy. We find that adoption rates are higher for initiatives appearing early in a list of recommendations. This sequence effect is consistent and large: simply moving a recommendation one position lower has the same effect on average as increasing up-front implementation cost by at least 17% from the average value. Given this impact of sequence on adoption of individual recommendations, we utilize variations within our data to examine how various sequencing approaches affect adoption at the portfolio level. Sequences in which recommendations are listed from best to worst payback achieve higher potential energy savings given the investments in energy efficiency made by the firms. We also observe a choice overload effect at the portfolio level, but the magnitude of this effect is small.|Suresh Muthulingam| Charles J.

A natural model for such an arrival process is a nonhomogeneous Poisson process (NHPP), but that should be tested by applying appropriate statistical tests to arrival data. Assuming that the NHPP has a rate that can be regarded as approximately piecewise-constant, a Kolmogorov–Smirnov (KS) statistical test of a Poisson process (PP) can be applied to test for a NHPP by combining data from separate subintervals, exploiting the classical conditional-uniform property. In this paper, we apply KS tests to banking call center and hospital emergency department arrival data and show that they are consistent with the NHPP property, but only if that data is analyzed carefully. Initial testing rejected the NHPP null hypothesis because it failed to account for three common features of arrival data: (i) data rounding, e.g., to seconds; (ii) choosing subintervals over which the rate varies too much; and (iii) overdispersion caused by combining data from fixed hours on a fixed day of the week over multiple weeks that do not have the same arrival rate. In this paper, we investigate how to address each of these three problems.|Song-Hee Kim| Ward Whitt|||||||||Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027|Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

[Gallego, G., G. Iyengar, R. Phillips, A. Dubey. 2004. Managing flexible products on a network. CORC Technical Report TR-2004-01, Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York.] recently proposed a choice-based deterministic linear programming model (CDLP) for network revenue management (RM) that parallels the widely used deterministic linear programming (DLP) model. While they focused on analyzing “flexible products”—a situation in which the provider has the flexibility of using a collection of products (e.g., different flight times and/or itineraries) to serve the same market demand (e.g., an origin-destination connection)—their approach has broader implications for understanding choice-based RM on a network. In this paper, we explore the implications in detail. Specifically, we characterize optimal offer sets (sets of available network products) by extending to the network case a notion of “efficiency” developed by Talluri and van Ryzin [Talluri, K. T., G. J. van Ryzin. 2004. Revenue management under a general discrete choice model of consumer behavior. Management Sci.50 15–33.] for the single-leg, choice-based RM problem. We show that, asymptotically, as demand and capacity are scaled up, only these efficient sets are used in an optimal policy. This analysis suggests that efficiency is a potentially useful approach for identifying “good” offer sets on networks, as it is in the case of single-leg problems. Second, we propose a practical decomposition heuristic for converting the static CDLP solution into a dynamic control policy. The heuristic is quite similar to the familiar displacement-adjusted virtual nesting (DAVN) approximation used in traditional network RM, and it significantly improves on the performance of the static LP solution. We illustrate the heuristic on several numerical examples.|Qian Liu| Garrett van Ryzin|||||||||Industrial Engineering and Logistics Management Department, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong|Graduate School of Business, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027|||||||||HONG KONG|USA||||||||

We consider a Bayesian model of demand in which the unknown mean demand rate is assumed to have a prior, which is a mixture of two normal distributions corresponding to the demand forecast for an innovative (fashion) good. We develop three models of production flexibility: a static model requiring initial placement of both orders, a partially dynamic model requiring a fixing of the time that the second order will be made, and a fully dynamic model with no restrictions on ordering. Supplier flexibility is modeled through supply lead times. We observe that the magnitude of the savings from the static to the fully flexible model, corresponding to the sum of the values of information and production flexibility, reflects all sources of variability: differences between demand means of the prior mixture, variability within each prior, and variability about the observed mean. We observe that as the difference between high and low demand cases increases, the value of information increases, though for long lead times, production flexibility is required to take advantage of the updated information. Further, we observe that the greater the uncertainty within each prior distribution, the greater the value of information relative to the value of production flexibility, particularly for long lead times. However, the greater the uncertainty around the mean demand, which is the uncertainty that cannot be resolved through observation, the lower the value of information. Finally, we observe that the value of supply flexibility grows initially in a concave then convex manner as a function of the supply lead times.|Joseph M. Milner| Panos Kouvelis|||||||||John M.

We study a distribution channel that consists of a supplier who offers all-unit quantity discounts for batch orders to enjoy cost savings, and a reseller who may divert some goods to the gray markets. We show that the impact of gray markets depends on the reseller's inventory holding cost. When the reseller's inventory holding cost is high, diversion to the gray markets improves the channel performance by enabling the reseller to make batch orders. Because the reseller's order costs decrease through quantity discounts, diversion to the gray markets reduces the resale price and expands sales to the authorized channel. On the other hand, when the reseller's inventory holding cost is low, the reseller would make the batch orders even without the gray markets. In this case the diversion to the gray markets may improve the reseller's performance by shortening the order cycles and reducing the inventory holding costs. Interestingly, because diversion to the gray markets decreases the reseller's cycle inventory volume, the reseller has the reduced incentive to push its inventory, and, consequently, the resale price rises and sales volume decreases in the authorized channel. Moreover, there exists a range of reseller's inventory holding cost and supplier's cost of scale economy such that it is optimal for the supplier to induce reseller's gray market diversion through an all-unit discount. We show that these results are robust when the gray market overlaps with the authorized channel or when the gray market price is sensitive to reseller's diversion volume.|Ming Hu| J.

With the increasing length and complexity of today’s global supply chains, the buyer may face two issues when designing the sourcing contract: adverse selection (i.e., the supplier’s cost structure is private information) and noncontractible capacity (i.e., the supplier’s capacity investment is not contractible). We show that noncontractible capacity does not necessarily lead to a lower profit for the buyer, but it may require a more complex contract format to achieve the optimal (second-best) profit. Interestingly, we find that a single, linear contract (or a two-part tariff) could be optimal for the buyer under certain conditions. Even when such a contract is suboptimal, it can deliver close-to-optimal profit for the buyer for a wide range of situations. These findings indicate that the value of using a complex menu of contracts is negligible in such a supply chain setting. A simple two-part tariff is an attractive option for buyers whose goal is to ensure supply while facing both cost uncertainty and contractibility issues. The paper also provides a new explanation for the prevalence of such simple contracts in practice.|Ehsan Bolandifar| Tianjun Feng| Fuqiang Zhang||||||||CUHK Business School, Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong|School of Management, Fudan University, Shanghai, China 200433|Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130||||||||CHINA|CHINA|USA|||||||

By expediting open orders, back orders can be reduced. Order expediting is costly, and we include various types of expediting costs in the model. We prove structural properties of the model and show how the optimal parameters of the expediting policy can be computed efficiently. The expediting policy is easy to implement and, for situations with variable expediting cost only, the structure of the policy is optimal. For situations with nonvariable expediting costs, the expediting policy that we consider is generally not optimal. The optimal policy can be computed by dynamic programming, but this approach is computationally feasible only for small-problem instances. We conduct numerical experiments that are based on data from the service division of a global equipment manufacturer to evaluate the performances of the expediting policy and the optimal policy. The results show that substantial cost savings can be achieved by order expediting and that the expediting policy realizes a great share of the cost-saving potential offered by order expediting.|Raik Özsen| Ulrich W.

We study an observable M/M/1 queue that serves an unknown proportion of patient and impatient customers. The provider has a Bernoulli prior on this proportion, corresponding to an optimistic or pessimistic scenario. For every queue length, she chooses a low or a high price, or turns customers away. Only the high price is informative. The optimal Bayesian price for a queue state is belief-dependent if the optimal policies for the underlying scenarios disagree at that queue state; in this case the policy has a belief-threshold structure. The optimal Bayesian pricing policy as a function of queue length has a zone (or, nested-threshold) structure. Moreover, the price convergence under the optimal Bayesian policy is sensitive to the system size, i.e., the maximum queue length. We identify two cases: prices converge (1) almost surely to the optimal prices in either scenario or (2) with positive probability to suboptimal prices.

Several novel model-based approaches to managing such risks have been developed in the academic literature, but how behavioral tendencies may affect procurement decisions under such conditions has received relatively less attention. In this paper, we present results from a study where paid subjects were asked to place orders from two suppliers who differ in their costs and risks to satisfy a fixed amount of end-customer demand. We show that under such a scenario, it is theoretically optimal to sole source either from the more reliable (and more costly) supplier or from the more risky but cheaper supplier, depending on cost and risk parameters. Subjects in our experiment, however, show a systematic tendency to diversify their orders between the two sources. We document this diversification tendency in procurement decisions and its possible impact on profits under various cost and risk settings as well as comment on various ordering behavior observed during the experiments. We also establish that bounded rationality of subjects can provide a possible rationale for the above phenomenon.|Haresh Gurnani| Karthik Ramachandran| Saibal Ray| Yusen Xia|||||||School of Business Administration, University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida 33124|Scheller College of Business, Georgia Institute of Technology, Atlanta, Georgia 30308|Desautels Faculty of Management, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec H3A 1G5, Canada|Robinson College of Business, Georgia State University, Atlanta, Georgia 30303|||||||USA|USA|CANADA|USA||||||

In contrast, this paper takes a descriptive approach and considers bounded rationality, in the sense that decision makers are prone to errors and biases. Our decision model builds on the quantal choice model: While the best decision need not always be made, better decisions are made more often. We apply this framework to the classic newsvendor model and characterize the ordering decisions made by a boundedly rational decision maker. We identify systematic biases and offer insight into when overordering and underordering may occur. We also investigate the impact of these biases on several other inventory settings that have traditionally been studied using the newsvendor model as a building block, such as supply chain contracting, the bullwhip effect, and inventory pooling.

We develop a framework that can be utilized in determining the optimal appointment policies under different assumptions regarding rewards, costs, and decision variables. We propose two methods to evaluate the objective function for a given appointment schedule. We specifically consider two different formulations, both of which aim to balance the trade-off between the patient waiting times and server utilization and carry out a numerical study to provide insights into optimal policies. We find that policies that ignore interruptions perform quite badly, especially when the number of appointments to be scheduled is also a decision variable.

With the CBS policy, the number of working servers is dynamically adjusted according to the queue length. Besides lining up for free service, customers have the option of paying a fee and getting faster service. Customers' equilibrium behavior is studied under two information scenarios: In the no information scenario, customers only know the long-term statistics, such as the expected waiting time; in the partial information scenario, customers observe the number of working servers and understand the staffing policy upon their arrival. Unlike a queueing system with a constant staffing level, a positive externality is associated with customers' joining the CBS system. Both avoid-the-crowd and follow-the-crowd customer behaviors are possible, and multiple equilibria could exist. We develop the stationary performance measures of the system by considering the customers' strategic behavior.

Although the structure of most programs is the same, there is no clear dominant strategy for the type of vehicles that should be provided through car sharing. In this paper, we consider an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) that contemplates car sharing and designs its product line by accounting for the trade-off between driving performance and fuel efficiency under CAFE standards. Customers have different valuations of driving performance and decide whether to buy, join car sharing or rely on their outside options. We find that the OEM increases the fuel efficiency of the vehicles it provides through car sharing. This higher efficiency enables the OEM to charge a higher selling price to the higher end of the market, thus increasing its profit. This is especially beneficial to higher-end OEMs that face greater cannibalization and can explain why Daimler and BMW have been particularly active in introducing car sharing. Offering car sharing is not always environmentally beneficial. Even when it is, we find that doing so may reduce the OEM’s Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) level. In such cases, incentive multipliers should be granted for each shared car. Finally, if anticipating aggressive CAFE standards, OEMs may introduce car sharing to better absorb the increase in the production cost.|Ioannis Bellos| Mark Ferguson| L.

The retailer orders the product from the manufacturer prior to the beginning of the selling periods. We consider two types of customers: (1) strategic customers who take their future options into account and time their purchases accordingly and (2) myopic customers who consider only their current options. We compare the resulting equilibria for these two scenarios and evaluate the impact of customers’ strategic behavior. We find that strategic customer behavior always benefits the manufacturer. Interestingly, it may also improve the profitability of the retailer and the entire supply chain in some cases. Strategic customer behavior and decentralization are often regarded as detriments to supply chain performance. We find that, however, the combination of these two factors may not result in the worst supply chain performance. When customers are sufficiently patient, a decentralized supply chain that faces strategic customers actually outperforms the supply chain with only one of those factors at play. Finally, we show that when customers are strategic, the retailer’s and manufacturer’s profits with price commitment, availability commitment, or quick response can be lower than those when customers are myopic.|Yen-Ting Lin | Ali K.

We use quarterly data on all major carriers, available since the introduction of required reporting of service indicators to the U.S. Department of Transportation. Our analysis demonstrates two main points. First, the relationship between operational performance and profitability is contingent on a company's operating model; “focused” airlines show a link between late arrivals and profitability while full-service airlines do not. Also, capacity utilization is a stronger driver of profitability for full-service airlines than for focused airlines. Second, focused airlines outperform the rest of the industry in terms of profitability.|Nikos Tsikriktsis||||||||||Management Science and Operations Department, London Business School, Regent's Park, London NW1 4SA, United Kingdom||||||||||UNITED KINGDOM|||||||||

To build supply chain capabilities, organizations face a choice between two fundamentally different sourcing strategies—reactive capacity and safety stock. We develop a framework to guide the joint sourcing strategy that minimizes the long-run average cost under a target service level. A salient feature of our modeling framework is a novel demand model that captures important continuous-time, non-Markovian characteristics of demand surge trajectories. In addition to the total magnitude as typically modeled in the literature, we define several other metrics of surges, including duration, intensity, compactness, peak position, volatility, and frequency. The resulting optimization problem is challenging because it requires evaluating, for any sample path, whether surge demand can be satisfied at every point in time—a refined feature that traditional models do not have. To identify the optimal strategy, we first characterize the optimal production and deployment policy for any given strategy and then transform the original problem into two equivalent but more tractable problems. Finally, through stochastic comparison techniques, we show how the magnitude and predictability of surge demand characteristics (mentioned above) and the cost profiles of each strategy impact the optimal joint strategy.|Lu Huang| Jing-Sheng Song| Jordan Tong||||||||Google Inc., Mountain View, California 94043|Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708|Wisconsin School of Business, University of Wisconsin鈥揗adison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

Queueing-based models of pricing primarily focus on charging a fee per use for the service, in part because per-use pricing enables the firm to regulate congestion—raising the per-use price naturally reduces how frequently customers use a service. The firm has less control over usage with subscription pricing (by definition, with subscription pricing customers are not charged proportional to their actual usage), and this is a disadvantage when customers dislike congestion. However, we show that subscription pricing is more effective at earning revenue. Consequently, the firm may be better off with subscription pricing, even, surprisingly, when congestion is intuitively most problematic for the firm: e.g., as congestion becomes more disliked by consumers. We show that the absolute advantage of subscription pricing relative to per-use pricing can be substantial, whereas the potential advantage of per-use pricing is generally modest. Subscription pricing becomes relatively more attractive if consumers become more heterogeneous in their service rates (e.g., some know they are “heavy” users and others know they are “light” users) as long as capacity is fixed, the potential utilization is high, and the two segments have substantially different usage rates. Otherwise, heterogeneity in usage rates makes subscription pricing less attractive relative to per-use pricing. We conclude that subscription pricing can be effective even if congestion is relevant for the overall quality of a service.|Gérard P.

By comparing two types of counterfeiters—deceptive, so infiltrating a licit (but complicit) distributor, or nondeceptive in an illicit channel—we provide insights into the impact of anticounterfeiting strategies on a brand-name company, a counterfeiter, and consumers. Our analysis highlights that the effectiveness of these strategies depends critically on whether a brand-name company faces a nondeceptive or deceptive counterfeiter. For example, by improving quality, the brand-name company can improve her expected profit against a nondeceptive counterfeiter when the counterfeiter steals an insignificant amount of brand value. However, the same strategy does not work well against the deceptive counterfeiter unless high quality facilitates the seizure of deceptive counterfeits significantly. Similarly, reducing price works well in combating the nondeceptive counterfeiter, but it could be ineffective against the deceptive counterfeiter. Moreover, the strategies that improve the profit of the brand-name company may benefit the counterfeiter inadvertently and even hurt consumer welfare. Therefore, firms and governments should carefully consider a trade-off among different objectives in implementing an anticounterfeiting strategy.|Soo-Haeng Cho| Xin Fang| Sridhar Tayur||||||||Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213|Lee Kong Chian School of Business, Singapore Management University, Singapore 178899|Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213||||||||USA|SINGAPORE|USA|||||||

Rao|CBA, University of Cincinnati, Cincinnati, Ohio 45221|inventory/production; joint replenishment; worst-case analysis|This paper compares the commonly used periodic review, replenishment interval, order-up-to (R, T ) policy to the continuous review, reorder point, order quantity, (Q, r) model. We show that long-run average cost function for the single-product (R, T ) policy has a structure similar to that of the (Q, r) model. Consequently, many of the useful properties of the latter model are applicable. In particular, the optimal cost is insensitive to the choice of the replenishment interval, T, provided the optimal order-up-to level, R, corresponding to T is used. For instance, a suboptimal T obtained from a deterministic analysis increases costs by no more than 6.125%. For continuous demand, we analytically prove that use of a (R, T)policy instead of the optimal policy increases costs by at most 41.42% in the worst case. Computational experiments on Poisson demand demonstrate that the average-case relative error of using a (R,T)policy is under 7.5%. This relative error is lower when the demand rate and leadtime are high and the fixed order costs are either very low or very high. When coordination of order placement epochs is desirable, the (R,T) policy may sometimes be preferred to the (Q, r) policy. In this context, we illustrate application of our single-product results to more complex systems. In particular, we show that a simple power-of-two, (R,T) based heuristic for the stochastic multiproduct joint replenishment problem has a worst-case performance guarantee of 1.5.

These models predict that inventories carried by a retailer should be a function of the product variety carried by the retailer, distribution system characteristics, economies of scale, etc. A few recent empirical studies have explored the impact of some of these factors on aggregate inventories at U.S. retailers. Building on these works, this study empirically explores the role of key factors such as product variety, number of stores, and number of warehouses in explaining inventory levels at U.S. retailers using data obtained from both primary and secondary sources. We find that variety as measured by the number of stock-keeping units carried and number of stores is associated with higher inventories, whereas scale economies are associated with lower inventories. We do not find the number of warehouses to be significant in explaining inventory levels. Increased demand fluctuations are also associated with higher inventories, although the effects are less robust. The significant variables together with retailer segment identifiers explain a substantial fraction of the variance in inventory levels and can be potentially useful to managers in benchmarking their inventory levels.|Sampath Rajagopalan||||||||||Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089||||||||||USA|||||||||

Firms usually adopt a price-discrimination policy by offering a trade-in rebate only to the replacement customers to hasten their purchase decisions. Any return flow of products induced by trade-in rebates has the potential to generate revenues through remanufacturing operations. In this paper, we study the optimal pricing/trade-in strategies for such durable, remanufacturable products. We focus on the scenario where the replacement customers are only interested in trade-ins. In this setting, we study three pricing schemes: (i) uniform price for all customers, (ii) age-independent price differentiation between new and replacement customers (i.e., constant rebate for replacement customers), and (iii) age-dependent price differentiation between new and replacement customers (i.e., age-dependent rebates for replacement customers). We characterize the roles that the durability of the product, the extent of return revenues, the age profile of existing products in the market, and the relative size of the two customer segments play in shaping the optimal prices and the amount of trade-in rebates offered. Throughout the paper we highlight the operational decisions that might influence the above factors, and we support our findings with real-life practices. In an extensive numerical study, we compare the profit potential of different pricing schemes and quantify the reward (penalty) associated with taking into account (ignoring) customer segmentation, the price-discrimination option, return revenues, and the age profile of existing products. On the basis of these results, we are able to identify the most favorable pricing strategy for the firm when faced with a particular market condition and discuss implications on the life-cycle pricing of durable, remanufacturable products.|Saibal Ray| Tamer Boyaci| Necati Aras||||||||Faculty of Management, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, PQ, H3A 2M1, Canada|Faculty of Management, McGill University, 1001 Sherbrooke Street West, Montreal, PQ, H3A 2M1, Canada|Industrial Engineering Department, Bo臒azi莽i University, Bebek, Istanbul, 34342, Turkey||||||||CANADA|CANADA|TURKEY|||||||

We study how consumers’ discount-seeking purchase deferrals affect online retailers’ return policy choices. Lenient returns may induce higher full-price sales by limiting consumer regret, while signaling clearance unavailability risk. Contrasting earlier research that concluded a monopolist must set the refund at the clearance price when strategic consumers were overlooked, we find that an optimal refund bounded by the clearance price can mitigate purchase deferrals only when a monopolist salvages at mild discounts. To explore conditions under which a monopolist permits “full-refund returns,” we consider three scenarios: we permit clearing inventory without a loss; we assume lenient returns stimulate aggregate demand; we consider consumers’ transaction costs. We also derive a unique rational expectations equilibrium for competing retailers, wherein each retailer’s equilibrium refund is nondecreasing in its clearance price. Furthermore, retailers with clearance prices below a threshold should not allow returns, and those who do, higher clearance revenues imply higher full prices, higher quantities, and higher profits. We conclude that a credible clearance partner salvaging at higher prices than those at competing clearance mediums helps retailers gain competitive advantage when selling to strategic consumers.|Mehmet Sekip Altug| Tolga Aydinliyim|||||||||Department of Decision Sciences, School of Business, George Washington University, Washington, DC 20052|Loomba Department of Management, Zicklin School of Business, Baruch College, City University of New York, New York, New York 10010|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

The former equilibrium always exists, whereas the latter exists only when the marginal cost of capacity is sufficiently low. We also show that both truthful information sharing and preplay communication have an equilibrium with higher profits. We then test the model's predictions experimentally. Contrary to our theoretical predictions, we show that private demand forecasts do not have a consistently negative effect on firm profits, though capacities are more misaligned.

The products differ only in their prices and delivery times. We assume that there are dedicated capacities for each product and that there is a standard industry delivery time for the regular (slower) product. The objective of the firm is to determine the delivery time of the express (faster) product and appropriately price the two products, taking into consideration the impact of delivery time reduction on capacity requirements and costs. We develop a model that integrates pricing and delivery time decisions with capacity requirements and costs, and study scenarios where the firm is constrained in capacity for none, one, or both product(s). We show how product differentiation decisions are influenced by capacity costs, and how the firm should adapt its differentiation strategy in response to a change in its operating dynamics. We first identify a market characteristic that governs the optimal pricing structure. We then show that the degree of product differentiation depends on both the absolute, as well as the relative values of the capacity costs. Provided that the capacity cost differential remains the same, higher capacity costs induce less time differentiation and less price differentiation. An increase in capacity cost differential increases price differentiation, but decreases time differentiation. The optimal prices depend, in addition to the above, on the market characteristic. We find that prices can actually decrease when the firm incurs capacity-related costs. We also explore the impact of substitutability on product differentiation, and illustrate our results in a numerical study.|Tamer Boyaci| Saibal Ray|||||||||Faculty of Management, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 1G5|Faculty of Management, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 1G5|||||||||CANADA|CANADA||||||||

Performance of clinical workflows depends not only on how various steps are carried out but also on when certain information items are collected. We report the results of a long-term empirical study that looked at the implementation of a radiology information system (RIS) at a large regional network of radiology clinics. We find that a failure to gather necessary clinical background information in earlier steps significantly delays later steps and causes them to hang over, with a significant impact on the total turnaround time of diagnostic reports. We show that information systems can solve this problem by separating the task of gathering information from its usage and relocating that task upstream in the workflow. We argue that such unbundling can lead to shorter report turnaround times even if it significantly increases the utilization of the bottleneck server. These results have broader implications for the optimal design of other clinical workflows, such as the process of filling prescriptions in pharmacies or the typical surgical preanesthesia evaluation in hospitals. Finally, we explain why the impact of addressing hang-over is often nonuniform across clinical modalities, providers, and patient types.|Atanu Lahiri| Abraham Seidmann|||||||||Foster School of Business, University of Washington, Seattle, Washington 98195|Simon School of Business, University of Rochester, Rochester, New York 14627|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

It is known that, when quality is exogenous, encroachment could make the retailer better off. Yet, when quality is endogenous and the manufacturer has enough flexibility in adjusting quality, we find that encroachment always makes the retailer worse off in a large variety of scenarios. We also establish that, while a higher manufacturer’s cost of quality hurts the retailer in absence of encroachment, it could benefit the retailer with encroachment. In addition, we show that a manufacturer offering differentiated products through two channels prefers to sell its high-quality product through the direct channel. Contrary to conventional wisdom, quality differentiation does not always benefit either manufacturer or retailer. Our results may explain why, despite extant theoretical predictions, retailers almost always resent encroachment. These findings also suggest that firms must be cautious when adopting quality differentiation as a strategy to ease channel conflict caused by encroachment.|Albert Ha| Xiaoyang Long| Javad Nasiry||||||||School of Business and Management, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong|School of Business and Management, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong|School of Business and Management, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong||||||||HONG KONG|HONG KONG|HONG KONG|||||||

However, the solution of such problems commonly requires an intermediary or a broker to manage information security concerns of individual participants. Our goal is to examine use of cryptographic techniques to attain the same result without the use of a broker. To illustrate this approach, we focus on a problem faced by independent trucking companies that have separate pick-up and delivery tasks and wish to identify potential efficiency-enhancing task swaps while limiting the information they must reveal to identify these swaps. We present an algorithm that finds opportunities to swap loads without revealing any information except the loads swapped, along with proofs of the security of the protocol. We also show that it is incentive compatible for each company to correctly follow the protocol as well as provide their true data. We apply this algorithm to an empirical data set from a large transportation company and present results that suggest significant opportunities to improve efficiency through Pareto improving swaps. This paper thus uses cryptographic arguments in an operations management problem context to show how an algorithm can be proven incentive compatible as well as demonstrate the potential value of its use on an empirical data set.|Chris Clifton| Ananth Iyer| Richard Cho| Wei Jiang| Murat Kantarcıoğlu| Jaideep Vaidya|||||Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907|Krannert School of Management, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907|Faculty of Business, University of New Brunswick Saint John, Saint John, New Brunswick Canada, E2L 4L5|Department of Computer Science, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907|Department of Computer Science, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75083|Management Science and Information Systems Department, Rutgers University, Newark, New Jersey 07102|||||USA|USA|CANADA|USA|USA|USA||||

Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109|supply base design; procurement auctions; bid-taker power|We study a buyer who periodically auctions off short-term supply contracts among her supply base. To mitigate significant cost shocks to procurement, the buyer can diversify her supply base by selecting suppliers from different regions. We find that the buyer's decision to diversify depends on her bid-taker power—that is, her ability to choose the auction mechanism. At one extreme, when the buyer has full bid-taker power and thus can dictatorially implement the optimal mechanism, she always prefers to diversify. At the other extreme, when the buyer uses a reverse English auction with no reserve price due to her lack of bid-taker power, she generally prefers to protect herself against potential price escalation from cost-advantaged suppliers by diversifying less. The managerial insight is that the more bid-taker power the buyer has to control price escalation from cost-advantaged suppliers the more she prefers a diversified supply base. This insight is shown to be robust to correlation between regional costs, ex ante asymmetry between regions, and intermediate levels of bid-taker power.|Zhixi Wan| Damian R.

The problem is to select steel coils from a set of waiting coils to form batches to be annealed in available batch annealing furnaces and choose a median coil for each furnace. The objective is to maximize the total reward of the selected coils less the total coil–coil and coil–furnace mismatching cost. For a special case of the problem that arises frequently in practical settings where the coils are all similar and there is only one type of furnace available, we develop a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm to obtain an optimal solution. For the general case of the problem, which is strongly NP-hard, an exact branch-and-price-and-cut solution algorithm is developed using a column and row generation framework. A variable reduction strategy is also proposed to accelerate the algorithm. The algorithm is capable of solving medium-size instances to optimality within a reasonable computation time. In addition, a tabu search heuristic is proposed for solving larger instances. Three simple search neighborhoods, as well as a sophisticated variable-depth neighborhood, are developed. This heuristic can generate near-optimal solutions for large instances within a short computation time. Using both randomly generated and real-world production data sets, we show that our algorithms are superior to the typical rule-based planning approach used by many steel plants. A decision support system that embeds our algorithms was developed and implemented at Baosteel to replace their rule-based planning method. The use of the system brings significant benefits to Baosteel, including an annual net profit increase of at least 1.76 million U.S. dollars and a large reduction of standard coal consumption and carbon dioxide emissions.|Lixin Tang| Ying Meng| Zhi-Long Chen| Jiyin Liu|||||||Liaoning Key Laboratory of Manufacturing System and Logistics, Institute of Industrial Engineering and Logistics Optimization, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110819, China|Liaoning Key Laboratory of Manufacturing System and Logistics, Institute of Industrial Engineering and Logistics Optimization, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110819, China|Robert H.

Research analyzing this area predominantly uses versions of the diffusion model to capture the demand trajectory of a new product with a fixed potential market. The classic Bass model assumes that demand for innovative products is influenced both by “external” media influence and “internal” word-of-mouth effect, but it excludes price and assumes that capacity is unlimited. In reality, both factors critically influence firms' strategies. Price fluctuations for a new product are common, and price is often a critical lever that helps to shape the demand. Also, firms often have significant capacity constraints, which influence the feasibility of their strategies. In this paper, we consider how a capacity-constrained firm prices products during new product introductions. Thus, the demand rate is influenced by price and, when capacity is insufficient, we allow some customers to be either lost or backlogged, which slows down the word-of-mouth effect. To understand the effect of both pricing and capacity, we consider the integrated optimal pricing, production, and inventory decisions, using control-theory framework (a generalization of the classic Bass model). Most of our results are fairly robust and apply under the assumption of lost sales and partial backlogging, as well as make-to-order and make-to-stock environments. We show that in most cases, the optimal trajectory of demand is unimodal, as in the Bass model, but the optimal price trajectory and the corresponding pricing policy are more complicated when capacity is limited. Using a numerical study, we explore when pricing flexibility is most valuable and whether simple pricing policies may be effective. We find that benefits of pricing flexibility are highest when capacity is neither unlimited (very large) nor very small and when word-of-mouth effect dominates direct impact from media. The ability to adjust prices is significantly more important than the option of producing in advance and holding inventory. We also find that simple pricing policies, appropriately chosen for given capacity, perform very well. In a numerical study, we show that demand uncertainty and increases in capacity over time do not affect our main insights.|Wenjing Shen| Izak Duenyas| Roman Kapuscinski||||||||LeBow College of Business, Drexel University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104|Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109|Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

We find that psychological safety—the belief that one can talk about errors without risk of punishment—and problem-solving efficacy—the belief that the organization will support employees' system improvement efforts—were positively correlated with frontline system improvement (FLSI). Surprisingly, felt responsibility was negatively associated with FLSI. These findings suggest that rather than relying on hiring motivated individuals, managers need to support employees' efforts to improve their work systems by creating a work environment where it is safe to talk about operational failures and responding to employee communication about operational failures. Doing this may result in higher levels of FLSI efforts and ultimately improve work processes.|Anita L.

Although the severity of influenza pandemics vary, evidence suggests that an efficient and rapid response is crucial for mitigating morbidity, mortality, and costs to society. Hence, preparing for a potential influenza pandemic is a high priority of governments at all levels (local, state, federal), nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and companies. In a severe pandemic, when a large number of people are ill, infected persons and their families may have difficulty purchasing and preparing meals. Various government agencies and NGOs plan to provide meals to these households. In this paper, in collaboration with the American Red Cross, we study food distribution planning during an influenza pandemic. We develop a disease spread model to estimate the spread pattern of the disease geographically and over time, combine it with a facility location and resource allocation network model for food distribution, and develop heuristics to find near-optimal solutions for large instances. We run our combined disease spread and facility location model for the state of Georgia and present the estimated number of infections and the number of meals needed in each census tract for a one-year period along with a design of the supply chain network. Moreover, we investigate the impact of voluntary quarantine on the food demand and the food distribution network and show that its effects on food distribution can be significant. Our results could help decision makers prepare for a pandemic, including how to allocate limited resources and respond dynamically.|Ali Ekici| Pınar Keskinocak| Julie L.

Previous work has established modularity (how decoupled a component is from other product components) as a critical determinant of defects, and we confirm its importance. Yet our study also provides empirical evidence for a relationship between product quality and cyclicality (the extent to which a component depends on itself via other product components). We find cyclicality to be a determinant of quality that is distinct from, and no less important than, modularity. Extending this main result, we show how the cyclicality–quality relationship is affected by the centrality of a component in a cycle and the distribution of a cycle across product modules.

Ross School of Business, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109|multilocation system; competition; search; inventory; pricing; information systems|A common phenomenon that occurs in any decentralized multilocation system is stock imbalance, whereby some locations have unsatisfied demands while others are overstocked. The system can be rebalanced by using a search process that is driven by either the customers or the retailers. In a customer-driven search (CDS), the customer with unmet demand may search for the product at another location and, if it is available, complete the purchase. In a retailer-driven search (RDS), the retailer with unsatisfied demand searches for product and schedules transshipment to fulfill the unmet demand at his location. Of course, the revenues generated through search in RDS need to be shared between the parties according to a transfer pricing scheme. In a setting of one manufacturer and two retailers with price-dependent and random demand, we explore the impact of the search method and the transfer price scheme used on the preferences of the manufacturer, the retailers, and the customers. With endogenous retail prices, we find that both the manufacturer and the retailers prefer RDS over CDS when they can design the transfer pricing scheme in RDS. Interestingly, neither party prefers the fixed transfer pricing scheme commonly assumed in the literature. Instead, transfer price that is proportional to the price of the retailer with either excess stock or excess demand is preferred. However, although both parties favor an RDS system when they can design the transfer pricing scheme in RDS, they may prefer RDS or CDS when the other party designs the RDS. Thus, the interests of the manufacturer and the retailers are rarely aligned. Customers benefit from a lower price in an RDS but at the expense of lower availability (as measured by the level of safety stock).|Li Jiang| Ravi Anupindi|||||||||Department of Logistics and Maritime Studies, Faculty of Business, Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Hong Kong SAR, China|Stephen M.

The outcome of information acquisition may turn out to be successful such that the firm learns much about the market demand, thus becoming “informed,” or unsuccessful such that it learns very little about the market demand, thus remaining “uninformed.” After the outcome becomes clear, the firm knows its information status, informed or uninformed, and the information content if informed. The client firm usually requires strict confidentiality that forbids the consultant to make any disclosure about the information acquisition, believing that greater informational advantage will surely be to its own benefits. As a result, neither the information content nor the information status is known to any third party. But should the firm always care so much about strict confidentiality? Will it be beneficial if the firm's information status, but not the information content, is known to its partners or any other firms? We investigate this issue in the context of a two-tier supply chain. A manufacturer offers a menu of contracts for supplying a product to a retailer who sells it in a market with random demand that has a known continuous distribution. The retailer hires a consultant to acquire demand information, with uncertain outcome. With probability t, the retailer becomes informed about the market demand, and with probability 1 − t, he remains uninformed, where the probability t can be regarded as representing the retailer's information acquisition capability. We find that disclosing its information status benefits the retailer if its information acquisition capability is less than stellar and the market variability is intermediate. Our investigation shows that there are benefits that are foregone by following strict confidentiality but can potentially be recovered by switching to a policy of partial confidentiality.|Tian Li| Shilu Tong| Hongtao Zhang||||||||School of Business, East China University of Science and Technology, 200237 Shanghai, China|School of Business and Management, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong|School of Business and Management, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong||||||||CHINA|HONG KONG|HONG KONG|||||||

We test the model on both simulated sales data and Intel's high-end desktop processor sales data. We use two alternative specifications for product strength in this market: performance and performance/price ratio. The former demonstrates better fit and forecast accuracy, likely due to the low price sensitivity of this high-end market. In addition, the parameter estimate suggests that, for the innovators in the diffusion of product adoption, brand switchings are more strongly influenced by product strength than within-brand product upgrades in this market. Our results indicate that compared with the Bass model, Norton–Bass model, and Jun–Park choice-based diffusion model, our approach is a better fit for strategic forecasting that occurs many months or years before the actual product launch.|Hongmin Li| Dieter Armbruster| Karl G.

In a sole-sourcing strategy, the buyer commits to sourcing from a single supplier (the incumbent) over the entire horizon. In a second-sourcing strategy, the buyer keeps the option open to source from a new supplier (the entrant) in the future. Supplier costs are private information, and the incumbent's cost may change in the future because of what it has learned. The buyer is relatively sure about current demand but uncertain about future demand. A supplier has to invest in capacity to produce the inputs for the buyer. With future private cost information, the incumbent earns rent in the future, and this prospective rent influences the incumbent's decision early in the horizon. On one hand, a second-sourcing strategy allows the buyer to take advantage of alternative sourcing opportunities, lowering her future cost. This benefit to the buyer is referred to as the option value of second sourcing. On the other hand, the future supplier competition in second-sourcing hurts the incumbent's future profit. The expectation of a lower future profit in second sourcing induces the incumbent to ask for a higher price at the beginning of the horizon. This causes more initial sourcing cost for the buyer in second sourcing than in sole sourcing, and is referred to as the cost of future supplier competition of second sourcing.|Cuihong Li| Laurens G.

We provide demand and return forecasts at the store-day level based on comparable movies. We estimate the parameters of various demand and return models using an iterative maximum-likelihood estimation and Bayesian estimation via Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation. Test results on data from a large movie rental firm reveal systematic underbuying of movies purchased through revenue-sharing contracts and overbuying of movies purchased through standard (nonrevenue-sharing) ones. For the movies considered, our model estimates an increase in the average profit per title for new movies by 15.5% and 2.5% for revenue sharing and standard titles, respectively.

technology supply chain"|Supply chains in key growth industries increasingly commercialize a critical piece of technology invented by an upstream technology supplier. The focal technology is licensed to specialist design firms and designed into products, which are fabricated by dedicated large-scale manufacturers. We examine a technology supplier’s licensing decision in such emerging multiparty networked supply chains in which a downstream design firm’s capability may not be publicly known. We find that the supply chain and firm profits are critically affected by whether or not a license agreement between a technology supplier and a design firm is kept confidential from a manufacturer. Instead of licensing to two downstream firms, a technology supplier may also license to an integrated firm with both design and manufacturing capabilities, which forms a conventional vertical supply chain. We compare a networked supply chain with a vertical supply chain and show that the network model can, under some conditions, outperform the integrated configuration and increase profits for all supply chain entities. In particular, a downstream firm can be better off decentralized, with design and manufacturing functions taken by different firms. Our research helps explain the emergence of such networked supply chains and offers insights on how to structure them to improve outcomes.|Jingqi Wang| Xiaole Wu| Viswanathan Krishnan||||||||Faculty of Business and Economics, The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong|Department of Management Science, Fudan University, Shanghai 200433, China|Rady School of Management, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093||||||||CHINA|CHINA|USA|||||||

Jones Graduate School of Management, Rice University, Houston, Texas 77252|dynamic pricing; game theory applications; marketing-operations interface; revenue management; strategic consumer behavior|We study the optimal pricing of a finite quantity of a fashion-like seasonal good in the presence of forward-looking (strategic) customers. We distinguish between two classes of pricing strategies: contingent and announced fixed-discount. In both cases, the seller acts as a Stackelberg leader announcing his pricing strategy, while consumers act as followers taking the seller's strategy as given and determining their purchasing behavior. In each case, we identify a subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium and show that given the seller's strategy, the equilibrium in the consumer subgame is unique and consists of symmetric threshold purchasing policies. For both cases, we develop a benchmark model in which customers are nonstrategic (myopic). We conduct a comprehensive numerical study to explore the impact of strategic consumer behavior on pricing policies and expected revenue performance. We show that strategic customer behavior suppresses the benefits of price segmentation, particularly under medium-to-high values of heterogeneity and modest rates of decline in valuations. However, when the level of consumer heterogeneity is small, the rate of decline is medium-to-high, and the seller can optimally choose the time of discount in advance, segmentation can be used quite effectively even with strategic consumers. We find that the seller cannot avoid the adverse impact of strategic consumer behavior even under low levels of initial inventory. We argue that while the seller expects customers to be more concerned about product availability at discount time, he cannot use high-price “betting” strategies as he would in the case of low inventory and myopic customers. Under certain qualifications, announced fixed-discount strategies perform essentially the same as contingent pricing policies in the case of myopic consumers. However, under strategic consumer behavior, announced pricing policies can be advantageous to the seller, compared to contingent pricing schemes. Interestingly, those cases that announced discount strategies offer a significant advantage compared to contingent pricing policies. They appear to offer only a minimal advantage in comparison to fixed-pricing policies. Finally, when the seller incorrectly assumes that strategic customers are myopic in their purchasing decisions, it can be quite costly, reaching potential revenue losses of about 20%.|Yossi Aviv| Amit Pazgal|||||||||Olin School of Business, Washington University, St. Louis, Missouri 63130|Jesse H.

This paper extends research on service operations failures by hypothesizing that attributions of blame also affect what matters to the customer during service failures. Specifically, we hypothesize that the relative weights that customers assign to key service elements in reaching an overall assessment of customer satisfaction are affected by customer attributions of blame for service failures. We use the U.S. airline industry as a quasi-experimental research setting to investigate the components of customer satisfaction for three samples of customers who experience (1) routine service, (2) flight delays of external (i.e., weather) origin, and (3) flight delays of internal origin. Although the level of customer satisfaction is lower for all service failures, we find that the key components of satisfaction differ between delayed and routine flights only when customers blame the service provider for the failure. Specifically, when delays are of external origin satisfaction is lower than for routine flights, but there is virtually no difference in the weight that customers assign to the components of customer satisfaction (including employee interactions). In contrast, when delays are of internal origin, satisfaction is lower than for either routine flights or flights delayed by external factors, and employee interactions have a significantly diminished role in customer satisfaction evaluations. Contrary to the popular view that employee interactions take on a greater role in determining customer satisfaction during service failures, we find that the opposite is true if the customer attributes blame to the service provider. Our findings highlight the important role of customer attributions during service failures and present more nuanced evidence on the role of employee-customer interactions in mitigating the effects of service failures on customer satisfaction.|Shannon W.

In this paper, we investigate the benefits from supplier diversification for dual-sourcing duopolists. We consider a two-echelon supply chain in which suppliers sell components to buyers who produce and sell substitutable products. The suppliers' output processes are uncertain and modeled as having a proportional random yield. Buyers engage in a quantity-based Cournot competition. We find that an increase in supplier correlation leads to more correlated buyers' outputs and a decrease in their profits. In the presence of end-market competition, dual sourcing still brings value by reducing the inefficiency caused by random yield: Namely, when the suppliers' yield processes are strongly negatively correlated, dual sourcing increases the expected market output and improves the firms' profits over sole sourcing. However, unlike a monopolist firm, a duopolist does not necessarily allocate its supplier orders to minimize output variability. We generalize the main results to a two-stage order-quantity–output-quantity game and to one with asymmetric suppliers.|Sammi Yu Tang| Panos Kouvelis|||||||||Department of Management, School of Business, University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida 33146|Olin School of Business, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

Second, by examining data that represents actual costs, prices, and yields encountered in the seed corn industry, we gain some insight into the value that the second production period provides.

There is a fixed total market of customers whose demands for the good or service are random and who divide their patronage between the firms in each period. Periodically, the market shares of the two firms can change based on the realized level of customer service provided in the prior period. We assume that the expected level of customer service can be expressed as a function of the (per customer) capacity of the firms' service delivery systems, and that service declines as the capacity decreases. The firms differ in their customers' willingness to defect when confronted by service failure. The primary issue we address is the firms' capacity decisions in response to customer service concerns and competitive pressure. We provide conditions under which the firms' optimal (i.e., equilibrium) capacity levels in a period are proportional to the size of their respective customer bases in that period. Further, we develop expressions for the value of a firm's customers and the implicit cost of service failure. Results for both single-period and finite-horizon problems are investigated and applied to two examples: (1) competition between Internet service providers who operate systems that we approximate by simple loss-type queueing models, and (2) competition between make-to-stock producers who operate systems that we approximate by newsvendor inventory models.

We develop a partially observable Markov decision process to optimize colonoscopy screening policies for the objective of maximizing total quality-adjusted life years. Our model incorporates age, gender, and risk of having CRC into the screening decisions and therefore provides a novel framework for personalized CRC screening. In addition to deriving the maximum attainable benefit from colonoscopy screening, which reflects the opportunity cost of following current guidelines, our results have several policy implications. Using clinical data, we show that the optimal colonoscopy screening policies may be more aggressive than the guidelines under some conditions. Optimal screening policies recommend that females with CRC history undergo colonoscopy more frequently than males. In contrast, females without CRC history should be screened less frequently than males. This result, which was not recognized before, signifies the role of gender in optimal CRC screening decisions.|Fatih Safa Erenay| Oguzhan Alagoz| Adnan Said||||||||Department of Management Sciences, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario N2L 3G1, Canada|Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Wisconsin鈥揗adison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706|Department of Medicine, University of Wisconsin鈥揗adison, Madison, Wisconsin 53792||||||||CANADA|USA|USA|||||||

At time 0, the risk-averse manufacturer selects the long-term contract price, at which point buyers choose one of the two channels. The resulting long-term contract demand is a deterministic fluid, while the spot-market demand is modeled as a stochastic renewal process. An exponential reflected random walk model is used to model the spot-market price, which is correlated with the spot-market demand process. The manufacturer accepts or rejects each electronic order, and long-term contracts and accepted electronic orders are backordered if necessary. The manufacturer’s control problem is to select the optimal long-term contract price as well as the optimal production (i.e., busy/idle) and electronic-order admission policies to maximize revenue minus inventory holding and backorder costs.

We model this phenomenon as a two-period contracting game with two identical suppliers, a single buyer, deterministic demand, and uncertain production costs. The suppliers are distressed at the start of the game and do not have access to external sources of capital; hence, revenues from the buyer are crucial in determining whether default occurs. The production cost of each supplier is the sum of two stochastic components: a common term that is identical for both suppliers (representing raw materials costs, design specifications, etc.) and an idiosyncratic term that is unique to a given supplier (representing inherent firm capability). The buyer chooses a supplier and then decides on a single- or two-period contract. Comparing models with and without the possibility of default, we find that, without the possibility of supplier failure, the buyer always prefers short-term contracts over long-term contracts, whereas this preference is typically reversed in the presence of failure. Neither of these contracts coordinates the supply chain. We also consider dynamic contracts, in which the contract price is partially tied to some index representing the common component of production costs (e.g., commodity prices of raw materials such as steel or oil), allowing the buyer to shoulder some of the risk from cost uncertainty. We find that dynamic long-term contracts allow the buyer to coordinate the supply chain in the presence of default risk. We also demonstrate that our results continue to hold under a variety of alternative assumptions, including stochastic demand, allowing the buyer the option of subsidizing a bankrupt supplier via a contingent transfer payment or loan and allowing the buyer to unilaterally renegotiate contracts. We conclude that the possibility of supplier default offers a new reason to prefer long-term contracts over short-term contracts.|Robert Swinney| Serguei Netessine|||||||||The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104|The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

Retailer demand is normally distributed and independent across retailers and over time. Travel times are fixed between pairs of system sites. Every m time periods, system inventory is replenished at the warehouse, whereupon an uncapacitated vehicle departs on a route that visits each retailer once and only once, allocating all of its inventory based on the status of inventory at the retailers who have not yet received allocations. The retailers experience newsvendor-type inventory-holding and backorder-penalty costs each period; the vehicle experiences in-transit inventory-holding costs each period. Our goal is to determine a combined system inventory-replenishment, routing, and inventory-allocation policy that minimizes the total expected cost/period of the system over an infinite time horizon. Our analysis begins by examining the determination of the optimal static route, i.e., the best route if the vehicle must travel the same route every replenishment-allocation cycle. Here we demonstrate that the optimal static route is not the shortest-total-distance (TSP) route, but depends on the variance of customer demands, and, if in-transit inventory-holding costs are charged, also on mean customer demands. We then examine dynamic-routing policies, i.e., policies that can change the route from one system-replenishment-allocation cycle to another, based on the status of the retailers’ inventories. Here we argue that in the absence of transportation-related cost, the optimal dynamic-routing policy should be viewed as balancing management’s ability to respond to system uncertainties (by changing routes) against system uncertainties that are induced by changing routes. We then examine the performance of a change-revert heuristic policy. Although its routing decisions are not fully dynamic, but determined and fixed for a given cycle at the time of each system replenishment, simulation tests with N = 2 and N = 6 retailers indicate that its use can substantially reduce system inventory-related costs even if most of the time the chosen route is the optimal static route.|Leroy B.

At the beginning of every summer, a fine wine distributor has to choose between purchasing bottled wine made from the harvest collected two years ago and wine futures of wine still aging in the barrel from the previous year’s harvest. At the end of the summer, after seeing weather and market fluctuations, the distributor can adjust its allocation by trading futures and bottles. This paper makes three contributions. First, we develop an analytical model to determine the optimal selection of bottled wine and wine futures under weather and market uncertainty. Our model is built on an empirical foundation in which the functional forms describing the evolution of futures and bottle prices are derived from comprehensive data associated with the most influential Bordeaux winemakers. Second, we develop structural properties of optimal decisions. We show that a wine distributor should always invest in wine futures because it increases the expected profit in spite of being a riskier asset than bottled wine. We characterize the influence of variation in various uncertainties in the problem. Third, our study empirically demonstrates for a large distributor the financial benefits of using our model. The hypothetical average profit improvement in our numerical analysis is significant, exceeding 21%, and its value becomes higher under risk aversion. The analysis is beneficial for fine wine distributors, as it provides insights into how to improve their selection in order to make financially healthier allocations.|Mert Hakan Hekimoğlu| Burak Kazaz| Scott Webster||||||||Lally School of Management, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, New York 12180|Whitman School of Management, Syracuse University, Syracuse, New York 13244|W.

Evidence from the Emergency Department|Diwas Singh KC|Goizueta Business School, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322|multitasking; productivity; quality; emergency department; capacity planning|This paper examines the effect of multitasking on overall worker performance, as measured by processing time, throughput rate, and output quality using microlevel operational data from the field. Specifically, we study the multitasking behavior of physicians in a busy hospital emergency department (ED). By drawing on recent findings in the experimental psychology literature and the nascent work in cognitive neuroscience, we develop several hypotheses for the effect of multitasking on worker performance. We first examine how multitasking affects a physician's processing time. We find that the total time taken to discharge a given number of patients has a U-shaped response to the level of physician multitasking; that is, multitasking initially helps to reduce the time taken, but only up to a certain threshold level, after which it increases in the level of multitasking. In addition, multitasking significantly impacts quality of care. Although lower levels of multitasking are associated with improved quality of care, at higher levels, additional multitasking leads to a smaller number of detected diagnoses and an increased likelihood of a 24-hour revisit rate to the ED. These findings have important implications for the design and organization of work in general and for the delivery of critical care in particular.|Diwas Singh KC||||||||||Goizueta Business School, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322||||||||||USA|||||||||

Customers often choose the busier restaurant, inferring that other customers in that restaurant know something that they do not. In an environment with random arrival and service times, customer behavior is reflected in the lengths of the queues that form at the individual servers. Therefore, queue lengths could signal two factors—potentially higher arrivals to the server or potentially slower service at the server. In this paper, we focus on both factors when customers' waiting costs are negligible. This allows us to understand how information externalities due to congestion impact customers' service choice behavior.|Senthil Veeraraghavan| Laurens Debo|||||||||The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104|Graduate School of Business, University of Chicago, Chicago, Illinois 60637|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

Although customers value reservations, restaurants typically neither charge for them nor impose penalties for failing to keep them. However, reservations impose costs on firms offering them. We offer a novel motivation for offering reservations that emphasizes the way in which reservations can alter customer behavior. We focus on a market in which demand is uncertain and the firm has limited capacity. There is a positive chance that the firm will not have enough capacity to serve all potential customers. Customers are unable to observe how many potential diners are in the market before incurring a cost to request service. Hence, if reservations are not offered, some may choose to stay home rather than risk being denied service. This lowers the firm's sales when realized demand is low. Reservations increase sales on a slow night by guaranteeing reservations holders service. However, some reservation holders may choose not to use their reservations resulting in no-shows. The firm must then trade off higher sales in a soft market with sales lost to no-shows on busy nights. We consequently evaluate various no-show mitigation strategies, all of which serve to make reservations more likely in equilibrium. Competition also makes reservations more attractive; when there are many small firms in the market, reservations are always offered.|Alexei Alexandrov| Martin A.

Under such a contract the distributor pays the plant a fixed price if the plant is operational and nothing if plant outage occurs. Pricing a unit-contingent contract is complicated by the fact that the plant's true status is its private information. The difference between the electricity spot price and the unit-contingent contract price provides an incentive for the plant to misreport its status and earn profit at the distributor's expense. To prevent misreporting, the distributor may inspect the plant and levy penalties if misreporting is discovered. We find that some type of misreporting under certain circumstances can benefit both the plant and the distributor, because it serves as a risk-allocation mechanism between the two parties. We show that such a risk-allocation mechanism is equivalent to using state-contingent options and prohibiting misreporting.|Owen Q. Wu| Volodymyr Babich|||||||||Stephen M.

The retailer faces a market with multiple segments of customers that are heterogeneous with respect to their product preferences. Customers arrive sequentially, and the firm decides which subset of products to offer to each arriving customer depending on the customer’s preferences, the inventory levels, and the remaining time in the season. We show that it is optimal to limit the choice set of some customers (even when the products are in stock), reserving products with low inventory levels for future customers who may have a stronger preference for those products. In certain settings, we prove that it is optimal to follow a threshold policy under which a product is offered to a customer segment if its inventory level is higher than a threshold value. The thresholds are decreasing in time and increasing in the inventory levels of other products. We introduce two heuristics derived by approximating the future marginal expected revenue by the marginal value of a newsvendor function that captures the substitution dynamics between products. We test the impact of assortment customization using data from a fashion retailer. We find that the potential revenue impact of assortment customization can be significant, especially when customer heterogeneity is high and when the products’ inventory-to-demand ratios are asymmetric. Our findings suggest that assortment customization can be used as another lever for revenue maximization in addition to pricing.|Fernando Bernstein| A.

DMEP combines dual-source (i.e., a less-expensive-but-slower base mode and a faster-but-more-expensive flexible mode) procurement with option contracts in three layers: a contract negotiation layer, where the firm chooses the best combination of lead time and price for each mode from the supply contract menu; a capacity reservation layer, where the firm reserves total equipment procurement quantities from the two supply modes before the planning horizon starts; and an execution layer, where the firm orders equipment from the two supply modes based on the updated demand information. We first investigate the execution layer as a dynamic dual-source capacity expansion problem with demand backlogging and demonstrate that the optimal policy lacks structure even under the simplest setting. Thus, we propose a heuristic solution for the execution-layer problem, which also serves as a building block for the other two layers. Through numerical analysis, we quantify the value of the added flexibility of DMEP for the firm.

We study the implications of ABL by examining how banks should determine asset-based loan terms based on firms’ operational characteristics (e.g., inventory salvage value and demand uncertainty) and how firms should make inventory stocking and capital structure decisions under asset-based borrowing constraints. Academic/practical relevance: Despite its widespread use for lending to small firms and those with large inventory investments, such as retailers, ABL has not been well studied in the literature. Methodology: We analyze ABL using a stylized single-period screening game of incomplete information between a business owner and a bank. The bank offers a menu of loans, where each loan offer is characterized by an interest rate and inventory advance rate. The owner then decides the inventory level and the mix of debt and equity with which to finance the firm’s operations. Our model captures the practical features of ABL, for example, the bank does not have the full knowledge of the firm’s demand prospects, and the inventory advance rate leads to a credit limit that increases in the firm’s inventory investment. Results: We show that ABL enables the bank to mitigate information asymmetry by screening firms and thereby controlling each firm type’s order quantity and leverage. We also obtain hypotheses describing the equilibrium loan contracts, capital structure, inventory investment, and bankruptcy outcomes. For instance, leverage leads to overinvestment resulting from the equity decision being endogenous to the model. Moreover, inventory advance rates are more sensitive to firms’ operational characteristics than interest rates. Managerial implications: Our study sheds light on the operational and financial implications of ABL by demonstrating how managers should make inventory and capital structure decisions while interacting with asset-based lenders.|Yasin Alan | Vishal Gaur|||||||||Owen Graduate School of Management, Vanderbilt University, Nashville, Tennessee 37203；|Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

From interviews, we learned that (1) FP and RL are the two most popular schemes; (2) PC is less popular, but it is used more often than CR and IL; and (3) a couple of firms are considering CR and IL and will probably use them in the future. By presenting a two-stage contracting model that incorporates a risk-neutral buyer and a risk-averse supplier under raw material price uncertainty and information asymmetry, we show that overhedging the supplier's risk with an IL contract can be optimal for the buyer in many cases. Using the model to study the effects of price trends, risk attitudes, information asymmetry, and constraints on purchase time, we find that each contract can be optimal in certain situations from certain standpoints. In particular, when a long-term relationship is considered, RL is equivalent to IL as long as the contract is self-enforcing, and RL can replace IL when no index is available. Connecting the analytical results to the interviews, we find that firms' choices and considerations can be well understood.|Wei Zhang| Deke Zhou| Liwen Liu||||||||Anderson School of Management, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095|School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China|School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China||||||||USA|CHINA|CHINA|||||||

trade-in rebates"|Trade-in remanufacturing is a commonly adopted business practice under which firms collect used products for remanufacturing by allowing repeat customers to trade in used products for upgraded ones at a discount price. This paper studies how customer purchasing behavior and remanufacturing efficiency affect the economic and environmental values of such a business practice. We demonstrate a new benefit of trade-in remanufacturing: it helps exploit the forward-looking behavior of strategic customers, which could be much more significant than the widely recognized revenue-generating and environmental benefits of remanufacturing. High remanufacturing efficiency does not necessarily benefit a firm. With overly high remanufacturing efficiency, product durability is so high that repeat customers are reluctant to trade in and upgrade their used products. When customers are highly strategic, trade-in remanufacturing creates a tension between profitability and sustainability: on one hand, by exploiting the intensive forward-looking customer behavior, trade-in remanufacturing is quite valuable to the firm; on the other hand, with highly strategic customers, trade-in remanufacturing has a substantial negative impact on the environment and social welfare, since it may induce significantly higher production quantities without improving customer surplus. With nearly myopic customers, however, trade-in remanufacturing benefits both the firm and the environment. Therefore, understanding the interactions between customer purchasing behavior and trade-in remanufacturing is important to both firms and policy makers. Finally, to resolve the above tension, we study how a social planner (e.g., government) should design a public policy to maximize social welfare. The social optimum can be achieved by using a simple linear subsidy/tax scheme for both new production and remanufacturing. The proposed policy can also induce the firm to set the socially optimal remanufacturing efficiency.|Fuqiang Zhang | Renyu Zhang |||||||||Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri |New York University Shanghai, Shanghai 200122, China|||||||||USA|CHINA||||||||

As a major improvement over this existing approach, we model the possibility of “shared” block time, which need only satisfy capacity constraints in expectation. We reduce the computational difficulty of the resulting NP-hard block-scheduling problem by implementing a column-generation approach and demonstrate the efficacy of this technique using simulation, calibrated to a real hospital's historical data and objectives.Our simulations illustrate substantial benefits to hospitals under a variety of circumstances and demonstrate the advantages of our new approach relative to a benchmark method taken from the recent literature.|Robert Day| Robert Garfinkel| Steven Thompson||||||||Operations and Information Management, School of Business, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06269|Operations and Information Management, School of Business, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06269|Management Department, Robins School of Business, University of Richmond, Richmond, Virginia 23173||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

Consequently, we achieve the following objectives: (1) to quantify the inaccuracy in the inventory-target estimation as a function of the length of the historical demand data, the critical fractile, and the shape parameters of the demand distribution; and (2) to determine the inventory target that minimizes the expected cost and accounts for the uncertainty around the demand parameters estimated from limited historical data. We achieve these objectives by using the concept of expected total operating cost and representing the demand distribution with the highly flexible Johnson translation system.

Collaboration imposes constraints on the capacity of the process because multitasking resources have to be simultaneously at the right place. We introduce the notions of collaboration architecture and unavoidable bottleneck idleness to study the maximal throughput or capacity of such networks. Collaboration and multitasking introduce synchronization requirements that may inflict unavoidable idleness of the bottleneck resources: even when the network is continuously busy (processing at capacity), bottleneck resources can never be fully utilized. The conventional approach that equates network capacity with bottleneck capacity is then incorrect because the network capacity is below that of the bottlenecks. In fact, the gap between the two can grow linearly with the number of collaborative activities. Our main result is that networks with nested collaboration architectures have no unavoidable bottleneck idleness. Then, regardless of the processing times of the various activities, the standard bottleneck procedure correctly identifies the network capacity. We also prove necessity in the sense that, for any nonnested architecture, there are values of processing times for which unavoidable idleness persists. The fundamental trade-off between collaboration and capacity does not disappear in multiserver networks and has important ramifications to service-system staffing. Yet, even in multiserver networks, a nested collaboration architecture still guarantees that the bottleneck capacity is achievable. Finally, simultaneous collaboration, as a process constraint, may limit the benefits of flexibility. We study the interplay of flexibility and unavoidable idleness and offer remedies derived from collaboration architectures.|Itai Gurvich| Jan A.

This variability along with patient preferences driving scheduling decisions resulted in both low operating room (OR) utilization and significant overtime for surgical teams at Mayo Clinic. In this paper we discuss the development of an improved scheduling approach for spine surgeries over a rolling planning horizon. First, data mining and statistical analysis was performed using a large data set to identify categories of surgeries that could be grouped together based on surgical time distributions and could be categorized at the time of case scheduling. These surgical categories are then used in a hierarchical optimization approach with the objective of maximizing a weighted combination of OR utilization and net profit. The optimization model is explored to consider trade-offs and relationships among utilization levels, financial performance, overtime allowance, and case mix. The new scheduling approach was implemented via a custom Web-based application that allowed the surgeons and schedulers to interactively identify best surgical days with patients. A pilot implementation resulted in a utilization increase of 19% and a reduction in overtime by 10%.|Asli Ozen| Yariv Marmor| Thomas Rohleder| Hari Balasubramanian| Jeanne Huddleston| Paul Huddleston|||||University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts 01003|ORT Braude College, 2161002 Karmiel, Israel;and Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905|3185 Rosemary Lane NE, Rochester, Minnesota 55906|University of Massachusetts Amherst, Amherst, Massachusetts 01003|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905|Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minnesota 55905|||||USA|ISRAEL|USA|USA|USA|USA|USA|||

In such problems, a seller provides a variety of products for which customers can construct a personalized bundle and send a request for quote (RFQ) to the seller. The seller, after reviewing the RFQ, has to determine a price based on which the customer either purchases the whole bundle or nothing. Such problems are faced by many companies in practice, and they are very difficult because of the potential unlimited possible configurations of the bundle and the correlations among the individual products. In this paper, we propose a novel top-down and bottom-up approach to solve this problem. In the top-down step, we decompose the bundle into each component and calibrate a value score for each component. In the bottom-up step, we aggregate the components back to the bundle, define important features of the bundle, and segment different RFQs by those bundle features as well as customer attributes. Then we estimate a utility function for each segment based on historical sales data and derive an optimal price for each incoming RFQ. We show that such a model overcomes the aforementioned difficulties and can be implemented efficiently. We test our approach using empirical data from a major information technology service provider and the test result shows that the proposed approach can improve the effectiveness of pricing significantly.|Zhengliang Xue| Zizhuo Wang| Markus Ettl||||||||IBM T.

In this paper, motivated by the influenza vaccine industry, we study a supply chain contracting problem in the presence of uncertainties surrounding design, delivery, and demand of the influenza vaccine. In this supply chain, a manufacturer has insufficient incentive to initiate at-risk early production prior to the design freeze because it is a retailer who reaps the most benefits from selling more vaccines delivered on time. Anticipating that late delivery will lead to potential loss in demand, the retailer tends to reduce the order size, which further discourages the manufacturer from making an effort to improve its delivery performance. To break this negative feedback loop, a supply contract needs to achieve two objectives: incentivize at-risk early production and eliminate double marginalization. We find that two commonly observed supply contracts in practice, the delivery-time-dependent quantity flexibility (D-QF) contract and the late-rebate (LR) contract, may fail to coordinate the supply chain because of the tension between these two objectives. To resolve such a tension, we construct a buyback-and-late-rebate (BLR) contract and show that a properly designed BLR contract can not only coordinate the supply chain but also can provide full flexibility of profit division between members of the supply chain. Numerical experiments further demonstrate that the BLR contract significantly improves supply chain efficiency compared to the contracts used in the industry.|Tinglong Dai| Soo-Haeng Cho| Fuqiang Zhang||||||||Carey Business School, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21202|Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213|Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

An alternative solution, called here the control-algorithm approach, is to use a math program (MP) to approximately represent the MDP and use its optimal solution to heuristically instantiate the parameters of the decision rules of a given set of control policies. As new information is observed over time, the control algorithm can incorporate it by re-solving the MP and revising the parameters of the decision rules with the newly obtained solution. The re-solving issue arises when one reflects on the consequences of this revision: Does the performance of the control algorithm really improve by revising its decision-rule instantiation with the solution of the re-solved MP, or should an appropriate modification of the prior solution be used? This paper analyzes the control-algorithm re-solving issue for a class of finite-horizon inventory- and revenue-management problems. It establishes sufficient conditions under which re-solving does not deteriorate the performance of a control algorithm, and it applies these results to control algorithms for network revenue management and multiproduct make-to-order production with lost sales and positive lead time.|Nicola Secomandi||||||||||Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213||||||||||USA|||||||||

We examine how the NGO's strategy changes as the NGO's pragmatism (i.e., the extent to which the NGO incorporates firms' profits into its decision making) increases. Our results demonstrate that when the NGO is less pragmatic, it should examine the existing market structure to determine whether to target the industry or the regulatory body. However, as the pragmatism of the NGO increases, the NGO should increasingly leverage the competition between firms to ensure that a replacement is available to consumers. We examine multiple extensions including varying the competition dynamics, the NGO targeting both the industry and the regulatory body, the time discounting of replacement costs, and a firm potentially lobbying to counteract an NGO's activism. We show that the potential for a firm to lobby can benefit consumers by motivating the NGO to exert more effort and increase the market sensitivity to a substance, thereby forcing the firm to replace.|Tim Kraft| Yanchong Zheng| Feryal Erhun||||||||Darden School of Business, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22903|Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142|Department of Management Science and Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

Individual choice decisions are modeled through an ordered list of preferences, and minimal assumptions are made about the statistical properties of this demand sequence. The firm manages the availability of products using a bid-price control strategy, and would like to optimize the control parameters. We formulate a continuous demand and capacity model for this problem that allows for the partial acceptance of requests. The model admits a simple calculation of the sample path gradient of the revenue function. This gradient is then used to construct a stochastic steepest ascent algorithm. We show that the algorithm converges (w.p.1) to a stationary point of the expected revenue function under mild conditions. The procedure is relatively efficient from a computational standpoint, and in our synthetic and real-data experiments performs comparably to or even better than other choice-based methods that are incompatible with the current infrastructure of RM systems.

We analyze information on 2,732 quality improvement initiatives implemented by 295 vendors of a car manufacturer and find that organizational forgetting affects quality gains obtained from both learning-by-doing (autonomous learning) and quality improvement initiatives (induced learning); more than 16% of quality gains from autonomous learning and 13% of quality gains from induced learning depreciate every year. Furthermore, the impact of organizational forgetting (i) differs across the types of quality improvement efforts (quality gains from process improvement initiatives depreciate, whereas those from quality assurance initiatives do not), and (ii) depends on where quality knowledge was embedded (depreciation is lower for knowledge embedded in technology than for knowledge embedded in organizational routines or organizational members).

Our problem formulation corresponds to the typical markdown management decisions in a retail chain. The solution methodology determines the optimal combinations of three important operational levers—pricing, inventory allocation, and store consolidation. Inventory dependence causes the optimal price trajectory to decrease over time as the current on-hand inventory decreases. The optimal inventory allocation shifts more inventory to the larger stores as the inventory effect becomes stronger. Solution methodologies are also developed for the case of optimal constant prices, which leads to the same optimal inventory allocations. If all stores have the same seasonal variations and the inventory is allocated optimally, then all stores have identical price trajectories. Optimal consolidation of the inventory to a subset of the stores is also determined. Consolidation of inventory to a subset of stores can be beneficial even when there are no fixed costs of stocking a store. Using some typical parameter values for retail items, our calculations show that significant benefits can result from taking the inventory effect into account in pricing, inventory allocation, and store consolidation decisions.|Stephen A.

In this paper, we present a model that allows disruptions to be correlated with an uncertain joint distribution, and we apply distributionally robust optimization to minimize the expected cost under the worst-case distribution with given marginal disruption probabilities. The worst-case distribution has a practical interpretation with disruption propagation, and its sparse structure allows solving the problem efficiently. Our numerical results show that ignoring disruption correlation could lead to significant loss that increases dramatically in key factors such as source disaster probability, disruption propagation effect, and service interruption penalty. On the other hand, the robust model results in very low regret, even when disruptions are independent, and starts to outperform the model assuming independence when disruptions are mildly correlated. Most of the benefit of the robust model can be captured with a very low additional cost, which makes it easy to implement. Given these advantages, we believe that the robust model can serve as a promising alternative approach for solving reliable facility location problems.|Mengshi Lu| Lun Ran| Zuo-Jun Max Shen||||||||Krannert School of Management, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907|School of Management and Economics, Beijing Institute of Technology, Beijing 100081, China|Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, and Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720||||||||USA|CHINA|USA|||||||

Exchanges occur in cycles or in chains in which each agent gives a good to the next agent. Kidney exchange is an important type of barter exchange market that allows incompatible patient–donor pairs to exchange kidneys so the involved patients can receive a transplant. The clearing problem is to find an allocation of donors to patients that is optimal with respect to multiple criteria. To achieve the best possible score on all criteria, long cycles and chains are often needed, particularly when there are many hard-to-match patients. In this paper we show why this may pose difficulties for existing approaches to the optimization of kidney exchanges. We then present a generic iterative branch-and-price algorithm that can deal effectively with multiple criteria, and we show how the pricing problem may be solved in polynomial time for a general class of criteria. Our algorithm is effective even for large, realistic patient–donor pools.

We approach this problem in a novel way by formulating a dynamic optimization model in which the demand function is isoelastic but the random demand process is quite general. Ultimately, what we find is a strong parallel between the dynamic pricing problem and dynamic inventory models. This parallel leads to a reinterpretation of the dynamic pricing problem as a price-setting newsvendor problem with recourse, which is useful not only because it yields insights into the optimal solution, but also because it leads to additional insights into how pricing recourse affects the actions and profits of a price-setting newsvendor. We make contributions in three areas: First, we develop structural properties that define an optimal pricing strategy over a finite horizon and investigate how that policy impacts a newsvendor's optimal procurement policy and optimal expected profit. Second, we establish a practical and efficient algorithm for computing the optimal prices. Third, we examine how market parameters affect the optimal solution through a series of numerical experiments that utilize the algorithm.|George E. Monahan| Nicholas C.

We investigate the performance of auctions with rank feedback in a simple setting for which analytical benchmarks are readily available. We test these benchmarks in the laboratory by comparing the performance of auctions with rank-based feedback to auctions with full-price feedback as well as to auctions with no price feedback (sealed-bid auctions). When bidders are risk-neutral expected-profit maximizers, the buyer's expected costs should be the same under rank and full-price feedback; moreover, expected buyer costs should be the same as in a sealed-bid auction. However, when we test this theoretical equality in a controlled laboratory setting we find that, consistent with practitioners' beliefs but contrary to our model, rank feedback results in lower average prices than full-price feedback. We identify two behavioral reasons for the difference. The first explanation is based on the similarity of the bidders' problem in a sealed-bid first-price auction and an open-bid auction with rank feedback. The second explanation incorporates the use of jump bids motivated by bidder impatience.|Wedad J. Elmaghraby| Elena Katok| Natalia Santamaría||||||||Robert H.

Second, it tests the hypothesis that, to maximize benefits from their ERP projects, organizations should align their ERP competence-building mechanisms with the ERP needs that arise from their operational environment. The analysis of a sample of manufacturing companies that implemented ERP between 1995 and 2001 uncovers four distinct configurations representing different degrees of fit between needs and competence-building mechanisms: the frugal ERP, the extensive business process reengineering (BPR), the adaptive ERP, and the straitjacket. The results support our hypothesis and suggest that the consequences of a misfit between needs and competence-building mechanisms are more severe for companies that operate in complex and dynamic environments and have informal organizational structures than for firms with rigid structures that operate in simple and stable environments.|Andrea Masini| Luk N.

We utilize a discrete-time model in which the inventory level is chosen before the start of a finite rental season, and customers not immediately served are lost. Demand, rental durations, and rental unit lifetimes are stochastic; sample path coupling allows us to derive structural results that hold under limited distributional assumptions. Considering different “recirculation” rules (i.e., which unit to select to meet a demand), we prove the concavity of the expected profit function and identify the optimal recirculation rule under two different models of a rental unit’s state: the number of times rented out or its condition. We develop two upper bounds on the number of lost rental units and two heuristics for the inventory decision. Numerical study shows the following: (1) accounting for rental unit loss can increase the expected profit by 7% for a single season; (2) the optimal inventory level in response to increasing loss probability is nonmonotonic; (3) both heuristics perform well; and (4) choosing the optimal recirculation rule over a commonly used policy can increase the profit-maximizing service level by up to six percentage points.|Vincent W.

Using the single-unit decomposition approach, we provide certain general conditions on the demand and cost processes under which a myopic policy is optimal. Under these conditions, the optimal policy is a myopic state-dependent base-stock policy, which can be expressed in closed form as a base-probability policy. Specifically, the order associated with a given customer should be placed if and only if its arrival probability within the leadtime is higher than a threshold. Our results generalize earlier conditions for the optimality of myopic policies. Namely, we show that myopic policies can be optimal even when the demand is correlated or stochastically decreasing.|Victor Martínez-de-Albéniz| Alejandro Lago|||||||||IESE Business School, University of Navarra, 08034 Barcelona, Spain|IESE Business School, University of Navarra, 08034 Barcelona, Spain|||||||||SPAIN|SPAIN||||||||

In particular, the demand process is an integrated moving average process of order (0, 1, 1), for which an exponential-weighted moving average provides the optimal forecast. For the assumed control policy we characterize the inventory random variable and use this to find the safety stock requirements for the system. From this characterization, we see that the required inventory, both in absolute terms and as it depends on the replenishment lead-time, behaves much differently for this case of nonstationary demand compared with stationary demand. We then show how the single-item model extends to a multi-stage, or supply-chain context; in particular we see that the demand process for the upstream stage is not only nonstationary but also more variable than that for the downstream stage. We also show that for this model there is no value from letting the upstream stages see the exogenous demand. The paper concludes with some observations about the practical implications of this work.|Stephen C. Graves||||||||||Leaders for Manufacturing Program and A. P.

If the rate at which customers balk and renege is an increasing, concave function of the number of customers in the system (head count), then the head-count process and the expected rate of lost sales are decreasing and convex in the capacity (service rate or number of servers). This result applies when customers cannot observe the head count, so that the balking probability is zero and the reneging rate increases linearly with the head count. Then the optimal capacity increases with the customer arrival rate but is not monotonic in the reneging rate per customer. When capacity is expensive or the reneging rate is high, the optimal capacity decreases with any further increase in the reneging rate. Therefore, managers must understand customers' impatience to avoid building too much capacity, but customers have an incentive to conceal their impatience, to avoid a degradation in service quality. If the system manager can prevent customers from reneging during service (by requiring advance payment or training employees to establish rapport with customers), the system's convexity properties are qualitatively different, but its comparative statics remain the same. Most important, the prevention of reneging during service can substantially reduce the total expected cost of lost sales and capacity. It increases the optimal capacity (service rate or number of servers) when capacity is expensive and reduces the optimal capacity when capacity is cheap.|Mor Armony| Erica Plambeck| Sridhar Seshadri||||||||Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, New York 10012|Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305|Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, New York 10012||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

These guidelines, implemented since July 2007, encourage the reuse of cash by (i) penalizing a DI for the practice of cross shipping, the near-simultaneous deposit of used cash to—and withdrawal of fit cash from—the Fed; and (ii) offering a custodial inventory program that enables a DI to transfer fit cash to the Fed's books, but physically hold it within the DI's secured facility. The effective management of the inventory of cash under these new guidelines is both a challenging and important issue for DIs. We introduce two new multiperiod models—designed specifically to capture the operations of a medium-size DI—that emerge from the DI's objective to minimize the total cost incurred in managing the inventory of cash over a finite planning horizon. The Basic Model (BM) captures the DI's mode of operations if it chooses not to locally reuse cash and, instead, incur the cross-shipping penalty. Using two important structural properties, we provide a polynomial-time dynamic programming algorithm for BM. The Reuse Model (RM) represents the DI's actions when it locally recirculates cash. We first prove the hardness of RM and then develop an integer programming formulation. A comprehensive test bed—based on our interaction with a leading secure-logistics provider—helps us to develop several useful insights into the relative impacts of the DI-specific parameters and the Fed's cross-shipping fee on the effective management of cash. In particular, we show that the Value of Local Reuse for a DI, measured as the percentage cost saving between the optimal solutions of BM and RM, is substantial, and we analyze the forces that influence the volume of cross shipping. We also develop a rolling-horizon procedure to adapt the optimal solutions of BM and RM for obtaining near-optimal real-time solutions in the presence of a modest amount of uncertainty. Finally, we provide a comparative analysis of a DI's decisions under the Fed's mechanism and those under a socially optimal mechanism.|Yunxia Zhu| Milind Dawande| Chelliah Sriskandarajah||||||||School of Management, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75083|School of Management, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75083|School of Management, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75083||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

In this paper, we develop and analyze a model of the key trade-offs sellers face in such a dual-channel setting built around the optimal choice of three design parameters: the posted price, the auction lot size, and the auction duration. Our results show how a monopolist seller can increase his revenues by offering auctions and a fixed price concurrently, and we identify when either a posted price only or a dual-channel strategy is optimal for the seller. We model consumer choice of channels, and thus market segmentation, and find a unique (symmetric) auction-participation equilibrium exists in which consumers who value the item for more than its posted price use a threshold policy to choose between the two channels. The threshold defines an upper bound on the remaining time of the auction. We explain how optimizing the design parameters enables the seller to segment the market so that the two channels reinforce each other and cannibalization is mitigated. Our findings also demonstrate that there are two dominant auction design strategies in this setting: one-unit auctions that tend to be short and long multiunit auctions. The optimal strategy for the seller depends on the consumer arrival rate and the disutility of delivery delay incurred by high-valuation consumers. In either case, the optimal design of the dual channel can significantly outperform a single posted-price channel. We show even greater benefits over a naive approach to managing the two channels that optimizes each independently. Our results suggest that unless firms jointly manage these online channels, they may find that adding auctions actually reduces their revenues.|Hila Etzion| Edieal Pinker| Abraham Seidmann||||||||Stephen M.

Mild cost fluctuations merely affect firms’ profitability. Significant variations can lead to supply chain disruption. What are the best contracts to be used in supply chains exposed to fluctuating raw material costs? We ask this question in two contexts—in the presence and the absence of working capital constraint. Academic/practical relevance: We add a framework on how to optimally contract in the presence of stochastic costs and working capital constraints and help managers understand how they can increase profitability. Methodology: We present a game-theoretic study of a bilateral monopoly supply chain with stochastic demand, stochastic input costs, production lead times, and working capital constraints. The upstream firm announces a supply contract to which the downstream firm responds with an order quantity. The contract is a single-price, multi-instrument contract with optional default penalties. Many previously studied coordinating contracts, as well as some noncoordinating ones, are special cases of our general contract. Results: We derive necessary and sufficient conditions that the instruments of the general contract must satisfy for the contract to induce a coordinated outcome—both with and without working capital constraints. Then we translate these requirements into implementable contracts. Indexing (I) on raw material prices and using default penalties (Ps) is necessary, and an I&P revenue-sharing contract turns out to be the most versatile contract for these environments. Managerial implications: We provide clear guidelines on how to contract in situations where production costs of every supply chain member fluctuate significantly, possibly in the presence of working capital constraints.|Panos Kouvelis | Danko Turcic | Wenhui Zhao ||||||||Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130|Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130|Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai 200030, China||||||||USA|USA|CHINA|||||||

If and when realized, such changes affect the delicate balance between demand and supply and thus current prices should account for these future possibilities. We study the dynamic pricing problem of a retailer facing the prospect of a change in the demand function during a finite selling season with no inventory replenishment opportunity. In particular, the time of the change and the postchange demand function are unknown upfront, and we focus on the fundamental trade-off between collecting revenues from current demand and doing so for postchange demand, with the capacity constraint introducing the main tension. We develop a formulation that allows for isolating the role of dynamic pricing in balancing inventory consumption throughout the horizon. We establish that, in many settings, optimal pricing policies follow a monotone path up to the change in demand. We show how one may compare upfront the attractiveness of pre- and postchange demand conditions and how such a comparison depends on the problem primitives. We further analyze the impact of the model inputs on the optimal policy and its structure, ranging from the impact of model parameter changes to the impact of different representations of uncertainty about future demand.|Omar Besbes| Denis Sauré|||||||||Columbia Business School, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027|Department of Industrial Engineering, University of Chile, 8370439 Santiago, Chile|||||||||USA|CHILE||||||||

We find that average information gain from a telephone call is twice as much as that from visiting the web portal; customers prefer the telephone channel for health event-related information but prefer the web portal for structured seasonal information; and customers are polarized in their propensities of using the web channel and can be broadly classified into “web avoiders” and “web seekers.” Our model provides superior in-sample and out-of-sample fit than multiple benchmark models for aggregate and individual-level customer activity and has several managerial uses, such as capacity planning.|Kinshuk Jerath| Anuj Kumar| Serguei Netessine||||||||Columbia Business School, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027|Warrington College of Business Administration, University of Florida, Gainesville, Florida 32611|INSEAD, Singapore 138676||||||||USA|USA|SINGAPORE|||||||

This paper is motivated by ones in which a supplier sells its primary product to a buyer that incurs an emissions cost (voluntarily, or due to government-imposed climate policy) and sells co-products into markets without emissions costs. Emission-accounting standards provide three candidate rules for allocating the supplier’s emissions among its products. This paper shows that under the value-based allocation, imposing an emissions tax on the primary product can increase emissions, by motivating the supplier to lower the price and sell a larger quantity. In contrast, with the socially optimal choice of allocation rule characterized in this paper, imposing the emissions tax on the primary product can greatly reduce emissions and increase welfare. In the absence of climate policy, under value-based allocation, a buyer might achieve greater profit by paying to offset its supply chain emissions. That can motivate supplier innovation to reduce its production cost. In numerical examples, considering the rare earth cerium oxide (co-produced with iron) and palm oil (co-produced with palm meal), the choice of allocation rule has a large impact on emissions, a buyer’s profit, and social welfare.|Nur Sunar| Erica Plambeck|||||||||Kenan-Flagler Business School, The University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599|Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

We assume that excess demands are lost and unobserved, in which case sales data reveal information about physical inventory levels. We show that a probability distribution on physical inventory levels is a sufficient summary of past sales and replenishment observations, and that this probability distribution can be efficiently updated in a Bayesian fashion as observations are accumulated. We also demonstrate the use of this distribution as the basis for practical replenishment and inventory audit policies and illustrate how the needed parameters can be estimated using data from a large national retailer. Our replenishment policies avoid the problem of “freezing,” in which a physical inventory position persists at zero while the corresponding record is positive. In addition, simulation studies show that our replenishment policies recoup much of the cost of inventory record inaccuracy, and that our audit policy significantly outperforms the popular “zero balance walk” audit policy.|Nicole DeHoratius| Adam J.

Over the last several years, B2B exchanges have attempted to provide supply for storable industrial goods with some degree of design specification (as opposed to undifferentiated commodities). Through this research, we elucidate some aspects of how speculative online exchanges with a small number of participants might behave and the impact they will have on the use of long-term contracts for supply. By endogenizing the evolution of spot prices in response to buyers’ and their supplier’s actions, we produce price fluctuations that exhibit significant autocorrelation in such markets. We show that participating buyers accrue network benefits as the number of participating firms increases through the inventory-pooling effects, resulting in reduced costs for them. However, a supplier acting strategically will counteract such benefits by restricting availability of goods to the spot market, sacrificing short-term spot-market revenue for long-term contract volume.|Joseph M.

We collected data from a sample of these practices and tested two hypotheses: (H1) controlling for staff size, greater delegation through the use of more staff types will decrease the throughput of visits, and (H2) controlling for staff size, income per unit time generated by the practice is decreasing in the number of staff types.

Using a combination of analytic and simulation models, we demonstrate that adding an up-front estimate of patient complexity to conventional urgency-based classification can substantially improve both patient safety (by reducing the risk of adverse events) and operational efficiency (by shortening the average length of stay). Moreover, we find that EDs with high resource (physician and/or examination room) utilization, high heterogeneity in the treatment time between simple and complex patients, and a relatively equal number of simple and complex patients benefit most from complexity-augmented triage. Finally, we find that (1) although misclassification of a complex patient as simple is slightly more harmful than vice versa, complexity-augmented triage is relatively robust to misclassification error rates as high as 25%; (2) streaming patients based on complexity information and prioritizing them based on urgency is better than doing the reverse; and (3) separating simple and complex patients via streaming facilitates the application of lean methods that can further amplify the benefit of complexity-augmented triage.|Soroush Saghafian| Wallace J.

We derive an optimal policy for using the two freight modes for shipping each order. This freight-mode decision is delayed until manufacturing is complete and the optimal policy uses information about the demand incurred in the meantime. Furthermore, given that the two freight modes are used optimally for shipping each order, we solve our model for reorder point and order quantity that minimizes cost.

Our focus is on using information on orders in the replenishment pipeline, i.e., pipeline information, to achieve cost-efficient policies for requesting emergency shipments. We introduce a policy where the request for an emergency shipment is based on the time until an outstanding order will reach the stock point considered. The goal is to determine how long one should wait for stock in the replenishment pipeline before requesting an emergency shipment, and the cost effects of using pipeline information in this manner. The analysis utilizes results from queuing theory and provides a decomposition technique for optimizing the policy parameters that reduces the complex multiechelon problem to more manageable single-echelon problems.

Under certain conditions on price elasticities and cost fractions, we find a unique optimal revenue share for all products. Surprisingly, it is optimal for the retailer not to charge any storage fee in many situations even if she is allowed to do so. Both the retailer’s and manufacturers’ profits first increase and then remain constant as the capacity increases, which implies that an optimal capacity exists. We also find that the decentralized system requires no larger storage space than the centralized system at the expense of channel profit.

We develop a mild restriction satisfied by many common distributions that assures that the manufacturer's problem is readily amenable to analysis. The manufacturer's profit and sales quantity increase with market size, but the resulting wholesale price depends on how the market grows. For the cases we consider, we identify relative variability (i.e., the coefficient of variation) as key: As relative variability decreases, the retailer's price sensitivity decreases, the wholesale price increases, the decentralized system becomes more efficient (i.e., captures a greater share of potential profit), and the manufacturer's share of realized profit increases. Decreasing relative variability, however, may leave the retailer severely disadvantaged as the higher wholesale price reduces his profitability. We explore factors that may lead the manufacturer to set a wholesale price below that which would maximize her profit, concentrating on retailer participation in forecasting and retailer power. As these and other considerations can result in a wholesale price below what we initially suggest, our base model represents a worst-case analysis of supply-chain performance.|Martin A.

One common measure of successful call resolution is whether or not the call results in the customer calling back. This presents a natural trade-off between speed and quality, where speed is defined as the average time before an incoming call is answered (the average waiting time) and quality is defined as the percentage of all arriving calls that do not result in callbacks (the call resolution). The relevant control is the routing, that is, the decision concerning which agent should handle an arriving call when more than one agent is available. In an inverted-V model setting, we formulate an optimization problem with the dual performance objective of minimizing average customer waiting time and maximizing the call resolution. We solve this optimization problem asymptotically in the Halfin–Whitt many-server limit regime, interpret its solution as a routing control for the discrete-event system, and show via simulation that the interpreted routing control is on the efficient frontier. In particular, any routing control that has a lower average waiting time (higher call resolution) must also have a lower call resolution (higher average waiting time).|Dongyuan Zhan| Amy R.

By developing products as a family, the firm can reduce the cost of developing individual product variants due to the reuse of a common product platform. Such a platform, designed in an aggregate-planning phase that precedes the development of individual product variants, is itself expensive to develop. Hence, its costs must be weighted against the benefits of its reuse in a family. We offer a model for capturing costs of product development when the family consists of variants based on a common platform. It is shown that the model can be converted into a network-optimization problem, and the optimal product-family can be identified under fairly general conditions by determining the shortest path of its network formulation. We also analytically examine the effect of alternative product designs on product-family composition, and discuss the implications of investing in new-product technology.

The cost and scale of returns management issues necessitate a deeper understanding of how to deal with product returns. We develop an analytical model that describes how consumer purchase and return decisions are affected by a seller's pricing and restocking fee policy. Taking into account the consumers' strategic behavior, we derive the seller's optimal policy as a function of consumer preferences, consumer uncertainty about product attributes, consumer hassle cost for returns, and the effectiveness of the seller's forward and reverse channel capability. We allow for two sources of consumer uncertainty and show how the seller may use its price and restocking fee as a means of targeting a segment of consumers who know their product consumption utilities. We find that even if it is possible to eliminate returns costlessly through the provision of information about the fit between consumer preferences and product characteristics, returns can nevertheless be part of an optimal product sales process. That is, we identify conditions under which it is (or is not) optimal to provide product fit information to consumers. We show that the marginal value of information to the seller is decreasing in the operational efficiency of the seller's forward and reverse logistics process as well as the level of product uncertainty. We identify the impact of multiple product options and sources of consumer uncertainty on the model's results. The analysis generates testable hypotheses about how consumer-level and seller-level parameters affect the return policies observed in the marketplace.|Jeffrey D. Shulman| Anne T. Coughlan| R.

The market size in each period is random, following a stationary distribution. Consumers are loss averse with stochastic reference points that represent their beliefs about possible price and product availability. Given the distribution of reference points, they choose purchase plans to maximize their expected total utility, including gain-loss utility, before visiting the store, and follow the plans in the store. In anticipation of consumers' purchase plans, in each period, before demand uncertainty resolves, the firm chooses an initial order quantity. After the uncertainty resolves, the firm chooses a contingent price depending on the demand realization, with the option of clearing inventory by charging a sale price, and otherwise, posting a full price. Over repeated periods, the interaction of the firm’s operational decisions about ordering and contingent pricing and the consumers' purchase actions results in a distribution of reference points, and, in equilibrium, this distribution is consistent with consumers' beliefs. Under this framework of endogenized reference points, we fully characterize the firm’s optimal inventory and contingent pricing policies. We identify conditions under which the firm’s expected price and profit are increasing in the consumer loss aversion level. We also show that the firm can prefer demand variability over no-demand uncertainty. We obtain a set of insights into how consumers' loss aversion affects the firm’s optimal operational policies that are in stark contrast to those obtained in classic newsvendor models.

It is a departure from previous studies of random yield in that it defines the sale price and the purchasing cost as exogenous and increasing with decreasing yield. While this behavior can be observed in various industries (e.g., citrus), the paper focuses on the olive oil industry as its application. Production of olive oil is a challenging business as olives grow every other year; thus, a risky investment is involved. A new practice among olive oil producers involves leasing farm space from farmers to grow olives. When the yield of olives is low (because of weather, disease, etc.), the oil producer gets a second chance to buy olives from other farmers at a unit cost varying with the yield. In this case, the sale price of olive oil increases in the market place because of the reduced supply. When the yield is high, the company uses some of its olives for olive oil production and some are salvaged. After olives are pressed and olive oil is produced, the company experiences an uncertain demand. The paper makes four contributions: First, it is shown that the objective function is concave in the amount of farm space leased, so that the first-order conditions provide the globally optimal solution. Second, it illustrates how the total production of olive oil changes with the yield. Third, it proves that the optimal amount of farm space leased decreases under the presence of a second (and reliable) source of supply. Finally, unlike traditional yield papers, the fourth result shows that increased yield variance does not necessarily increase the optimal amount of farm space to be leased when there is a second chance to obtain supplies.|Burak Kazaz||||||||||School of Business, University of Miami, 414 Jenkins Building, Coral Gables, Florida 33124||||||||||USA|||||||||

First, we investigate the behavior of the assembly system under decentralized control. It is shown that the Nash equilibrium of the competitive assembly system exists but is never system optimal. Next, we examine the role of information in the assembly system. We consider horizontal information sharing on the inventory status between the suppliers and demonstrate when information is valuable from the perspectives of the system and the individual player. We find that information sharing mitigates the system’s competition penalty in some cases, but there are also instances in which information sharing can hurt a decentralized system. Although the manufacturer always prefers information sharing, it is sometimes in the interest of the suppliers to refuse to share information. Finally, we propose a demand-independent coordination scheme for managing decentralized supply chains with either a serial or an assembly structure. The coordination scheme has practical value because very often the firm’s head (or the owner of the supply chain) does not have the accurate demand information that the local managers have. Alternatively, the demand varies over time, and the coordination contracts have to be modified. Under the transfer payment contract, the system optimal policy is the unique Nash equilibrium in the decentralized supply chain. Discussion on the relationship between our coordination scheme and existing methods in the literature is also provided.|Fuqiang Zhang||||||||||Paul Merage School of Business, University of California, Irvine, California 92697-3125||||||||||USA|||||||||

The problem is analyzed as a Stackelberg game in which the vendor acts as the leader and buyers act as followers. A simple strategy is developed for the vendor to employ a uniform quantity-discount policy to coordinate buyers' replenishment times by the power-of-two policy. Solution procedures are developed for the equilibrium strategy. It is shown that time coordination generally has a substantial benefit for the vendor, although the benefit to the buyers may be limited. Furthermore, uniform quantity discounts to all buyers are normally feasible but not sufficient to achieve perfect channel coordination when buyers act independently.

Because of the complexity of the diagnostic technology, EID programs are often highly centralized with few laboratories testing blood samples from a large network of health facilities. This leads to long diagnostic delays and consequent failure of patients to collect results in a timely manner. Several point-of-care (POC) devices that provide rapid diagnosis within the health facilities are being developed to mitigate these drawbacks of centralized EID networks. We study the decision of which facilities should receive the POC device (the placement plan) using the EID program in Mozambique as a case study. We argue that the choice of an appropriate plan is critical to maximizing the public health impact of POC devices in the presence of tight budget constraints. To formalize this argument, we develop a detailed simulation model to evaluate the impact of a placement plan. It comprises two parts: an operational model that quantifies the impact of a POC placement plan on the diagnostic delay and a behavioral part that quantifies the impact of diagnostic delay on the likelihood of result collection by infants’ caregivers. We also develop an approximate version of these operational and patient behavior dynamics and embed them in an optimization model to generate candidate POC placement plans. We find that the optimization-based plan can result in up to 30% more patients collecting their results compared to rules of thumb that have practical appeal. Finally, we show that the effectiveness of POC devices is much higher than other operational improvements to the EID network such as increased laboratory capacity, reduced transportation delay, and more regularized transport.|Sarang Deo| Milind Sohoni|||||||||Indian School of Business, Hyderabad 500032, India|Indian School of Business, Hyderabad 500032, India|||||||||INDIA|INDIA||||||||

We solve for the buyer's optimal procurement contract. We show that the optimal contract can be interpreted as the buyer choosing between diversification and competition benefits. Better information increases diversification benefits and decreases competition benefits. Therefore, with better information the buyer is more inclined to diversify. Moreover, better information may increase or decrease the value of the dual-sourcing option, depending on the buyer's unit revenue: for large revenue, the buyer uses the dual sourcing option for diversification, the benefits of which increase with information; for small revenue, the buyer uses the dual sourcing option for competition, the benefits of which decrease with information. Surprisingly, as the reliability of the entire supply base decreases, the buyer may stop diversifying under asymmetric information (to leverage competition), whereas it would never do so under symmetric information. Finally, we analyze the effect of codependence between supply disruptions. We find that lower codependence leads the buyer to rely less on competition. Because competition keeps the information costs in check, a reduction in supplier codependence increases the buyer's value of information. Therefore, strategic actions to reduce codependence between supplier disruptions should not be seen as a substitute for learning about suppliers' reliabilities.|Zhibin (Ben) Yang| Göker Aydın| Volodymyr Babich| Damian R.

We prove that dynamic pricing converges to static pricing as inventory levels of all variates approach the number of remaining selling periods (assuming at most one customer arrival within each period). Our extensive numerical study of the effects of time and inventory depletion on the optimal pricing reveals two fundamental underlying driving forces of the complex price behavior: the level of inventory scarcity and the quality difference among products. We also compare the performance of three restricted pricing strategies: static, unified dynamic, and mixed dynamic pricing. We find that full-scale dynamic pricing is of great value in the presence of inventory scarcity, and initial inventory decisions are quite robust in the pricing scheme employed in the selling season.

This process creates a “browsing path” along which there is potential for repeated interaction between the user and the provider, giving rise to a dynamic optimization problem. A key metric that often underlies this recommendation process is the click-through rate (CTR) of candidate articles. Whereas CTR is a measure of instantaneous click likelihood, we analyze the performance improvement that one may achieve by some lookahead that accounts for the potential future path of users. To that end, by using some data of user path history at major media sites, we introduce and derive a representation of content along two key dimensions: clickability, the likelihood to click to an article when it is recommended; and engageability, the likelihood to click from an article when it hosts a recommendation. We then propose a class of heuristics that leverage both clickability and engageability, and provide theoretical support for favoring such path-focused heuristics over myopic heuristics that focus only on clickability (no lookahead). We conduct a live pilot experiment that measures the performance of a practical proxy of our proposed class, when integrated into the operating system of a worldwide leading provider of content recommendations, allowing us to estimate the aggregate improvement in clicks per visit relative to the CTR-driven current practice. The documented improvement highlights the importance and the practicality of efficiently incorporating the future path of users in real time.|Omar Besbes| Yonatan Gur| Assaf Zeevi||||||||Columbia University, New York, New York 10027|Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305|Columbia University, New York, New York 10027||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

Which system attributes drive overall performance, and how? To address these questions, we develop and analyze several heuristic methods, inspired by observation of common practice and numerical experiments.

In such a channel, several competitive forces interact with one another to affect the price and quantity decisions of the firms involved. These include: (1) the direct competition each supplier faces for producing the same component, (2) the indirect competition among the suppliers producing the set of complementary components needed for assembling the final product, and (3) the vertical interaction between the assembler and the component suppliers. This paper shows that the direct competition that one supplier faces helps improve the performance of the assembler and all the other suppliers in the channel; and surprisingly, it can help improve the performance of this particular supplier facing the competition as well. Second, the assembler benefits from a merger of suppliers producing different components in the complementary set.

Prior research has focused on how trade credit benefits firms by improving vertical supply chain relationships. This paper offers a novel perspective by examining whether trade credit benefits suppliers through a horizontal channel. Under the classic Bertrand competition framework, we analyze two competing firms’ price decisions with and without trade credit. We find that when the firms are financially constrained, trade credit softens horizontal price competition. Specifically, with trade credit, the firms will behave less aggressively in setting their prices for fear of incurring additional financing costs, resulting in equilibrium prices above the marginal cost, even if the products are perfect substitutes. Equilibrium profits under trade credit may thus be strictly higher than those under cash contracts. Furthermore, we find that with trade credit, a financially stronger firm may be able to exclude its weaker competitor from the market. We also investigate the relationship between the firms’ financial strength and their physical capacity in the competition with trade credit. We find that the horizontal benefit of trade credit over cash contracts increases as either the firms’ physical capacities increase or their financial status weakens. Therefore, with trade credit, firms’ financial constraints are a partial substitute for the role that physical capacity plays in price competition. Finally, we study the firms’ choice between offering trade credit and cash contracts. We find that trade credit is the equilibrium contract form if customers value trade credit, suggesting that the horizontal benefit of trade credit may complement its vertical roles.|Heikki Peura| S.

These issues can be addressed by residual value warranties, which refund part of the up-front price to customers who have zero or few claims according to a predetermined refund schedule.

Energy storage operations typically face limited operational flexibility characterized by the speed of storing and releasing energy, which makes the optimal policy, in general, difficult to compute. A widely used practice-based heuristic, the rolling intrinsic (RI) policy, generally performs well compared with an optimal policy but can significantly underperform in some cases. In this paper, we aim to understand the gap between the RI policy and the optimal policy and leverage the resulting insights to improve the RI policy. A new heuristic policy, the price-adjusted rolling intrinsic (PARI) policy, is developed based on theoretical analysis of storage options. This heuristic adjusts certain prices before applying the RI policy to provide the RI policy with estimates of the values of various storage options. We evaluate the performance of the RI and PARI polices using actual data from the natural gas industry. Our results show that, on average, the PARI policy recovers about 67% of the value loss of the RI policy. Furthermore, when the value loss of the RI policy is larger, the PARI policy tends to recover a higher fraction of that value loss.|Owen Q. Wu| Derek D. Wang| Zhenwei Qin||||||||Stephen M.

In a large organization production and marketing are traditionally measured in terms of performance criteria appropriate and relevant within the world in which they operate, rather than in terms of overall company performance. We consider a situation where the headquarters uses a simple linear transfer price between the two functions to govern the transactions. The misaligned incentives among these functional managers are caused by a transfer price between them that distorts the marginal production cost and revenue, as well as by a misallocation of cost: Marketing's pricing strategy influences expected leftover inventory, but only production incurs the cost. The misalignment can be mitigated through the following two ways. First, if production commits to a service level instead of an inventory level, both production and marketing, and hence the firm as a whole, are better off. Second, the same improvement can be achieved through organizational changes so that marketing becomes the dominant function. We also propose a mechanism that aligns the functional managers' incentives to be compatible to the firm.|Qing Li| Derek Atkins|||||||||Department of Information and Systems Management, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong|Faculty of Commerce and Business Administration, The University of British Columbia, 2053 Main Mall, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada V6T 1Z2|||||||||HONG KONG|CANADA||||||||

Companies considering the adoption of solar energy have an important choice: whether to purchase the system (direct ownership, or DO) or opt for an agreement with a service provider that offers third-party ownership (TPO). Although this decision is financially very important, empirical research comparing the two models from an operational perspective has been scarce. These issues are particularly relevant considering that federal and state incentives are commonly used to stimulate adoption. This paper presents an empirical analysis of the role of TPO in the operational performance of nonresidential solar energy installations in California. Using a panel data estimation framework, and accounting for factors that influence TPO adoption, the analysis shows that TPO systems performed, on average, approximately 4% better than DO systems) in terms of their production yield. This performance improvement is consistent with better system design under TPO, but not with better solar panel technology selection by TPO providers.|Jose A.

When patients in these countries initiate treatment, they typically remain on it until death; thus, policy makers and physicians follow nonabandonment policies. However, treated patients develop resistance to treatment, so in many cases untreated patients might benefit more from the drugs. In this paper we quantify the opportunity cost associated with restricting attention to nonabandonment policies. For this, we use an approximate dynamic programming framework to bound the benefit from allowing premature treatment termination. Our results indicate that in sub-Saharan Africa, the price associated with restricting attention to nonabandonment policies lies between 4.4% and 8.1% of the total treatment benefit. We also derive superior treatment allocation policies, which shed light on the role behavior and health progression play in prioritizing treatment initiation and termination.|Amin Khademi| Denis R.

This paper studies a manufacturer's multimarket facility network design problem and investigates the offshoring decision from a network capacity investment perspective. We analyze a firm that manufactures two products to serve two geographically separated markets using a common component and two localized final assemblies. The common part can be transported between the two markets that have different economic and demand characteristics. Two strategic network design questions arise naturally: (1) Should the common part be produced centrally or in two local facilities? (2) If a centralization strategy is adopted, in which market should the facility be located? We present a transportation cost threshold that captures costs, revenues, and demand risks, and below which centralization is optimal. The optimal location of commonality crucially depends on the relative magnitude of price and manufacturing cost differentials but also on demand size and uncertainty. Incorporating scale economies further enlarges the centralization's optimality region.|Lauren Xiaoyuan Lu| Jan A.

Agents find congestion costly and, hence, try to arrive when the system is underutilized. Working in discrete time, we characterize pure-strategy Nash equilibria for the case of ample service capacity. In this case, agents try to spread themselves out as much as possible and their self-interested actions will lead to a socially optimal outcome if all agents have the same well-behaved delay cost function. For even modest sized problems, the set of possible pure-strategy Nash equilibria is quite large, making implementation potentially cumbersome. We consequently examine mixed-strategy Nash equilibria and show that there is a unique symmetric Nash equilibrium. Not only is this equilibrium independent of the number of agents and their individual delay cost functions, the arrival pattern it generates approaches a discrete-time Poisson process as the number of agents and arrival points gets large. Our results extend to the case of time varying preferences. With an appropriate initialization, the results also extend to a system with limited capacity. Our model lends support to the traditional literature on managing service systems. This work has generally ignored customers strategically choosing arrival times. Rather it is commonly assumed that customers seek service according to some well-behaved process (e.g., that interarrival times follow a renewal process). We show that assuming Poisson arrivals is an acceptable assumption even with strategic customers if the population is large and the horizon is long.|Martin A. Lariviere| Jan A.

A pricing strategy may involve commitments to take actions that do not optimize short-term revenue given the information the firm learns about demand. For example, as already suggested in the literature, the firm could commit to a single price no matter whether demand is strong or weak. We introduce a new strategy—charge a “high” price only if demand is indeed “high,” otherwise offer a discount. This strategy discounts more frequently than would maximize revenue conditional on demand. Nevertheless, the frequent discounts attract consumers. We show that (i) the discount-frequently strategy is optimal (whether capacity is adjustable or not), (ii) discount-frequently is often much better than other pricing strategies, especially if no price commitment is made, and (iii) “overbuying” capacity (e.g., inventory) to attract consumers (by signaling availability and the likelihood of discounts) is a poor strategy. Contrary to some recommendations in the literature to limit markdowns and to purchase ample capacity, our results provide support for a strategy that embraces frequent discounts and moderate capacity.|Gérard P.

We consider two commonly used types of vessels—“liners” (ships whose routes are fixed in advance) and “trampers” (ships for which future route components are selected based on available shipping jobs)—and formulate a vessel profit maximization problem as a stochastic dynamic program. For liner vessels, the profit maximization reduces to the problem of minimizing refueling costs over a given route subject to random fuel prices and limited vessel fuel capacity. Under mild assumptions about the stochastic dynamics of fuel prices at different ports, we provide a characterization of the structural properties of the optimal liner refueling policies. For trampers, the vessel profit maximization combines refueling decisions and route selection, which adds a combinatorial aspect to the problem. We characterize the optimal policy in special cases where prices are constant through time and do not differ across ports and prices are constant through time and differ across ports. The structure of the optimal policy in such special cases yields insights on the complexity of the problem and also guides the construction of heuristics for the general problem setting.|Omar Besbes| Sergei Savin|||||||||The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104|Graduate School of Business, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

This result convinced six judges of the Roman Labor Court of Appeals—a court that exhibits increasing hazard rates—to switch from hearing-level FIFO to case-level FIFO.

By perfectly reliable we mean a supplier that delivers an amount identically equal to the amount desired, as is the case in the most basic variant of the newsvendor problem. By unreliable, we mean a supplier that with some probability delivers an amount strictly less than the amount desired. Our results indicate the following effects of unreliability: From the perspective of the newsvendor, the aggregate quantity ordered is higher than otherwise would be ordered if the newsvendor’s suppliers were completely reliable. From the perspective of end customers, however, the service level provided is lower than otherwise would be provided if the newsvendor’s suppliers were completely reliable. From the perspective of the suppliers, although reliability affects how much is ordered from a selected supplier, cost generally takes precedence over reliability when it comes to selecting suppliers in the first place. Even perfect reliability is no guarantee for qualification since, in an optimal solution, a given supplier will be selected only if all less-expensive suppliers are selected, regardless of the given supplier’s reliability level.

The estimation of offline waiting times is complicated by the fact that some offline customers do not return for service at their appointed time. We show that when demand is large and service is fast, for any fixed-capacity allocation decision, the two-dimensional process tracking the number of customers waiting in a line and offline collapses to one dimension, and we characterize the one-dimensional limit process as a reflected diffusion with linear drift. The analytic tractability of this one-dimensional limit process allows us to solve for the capacity allocation that minimizes average cost when there are costs associated with customer abandonments and queueing. We further show that in this limit regime, a simple scheme based on Little's Law to dynamically estimate in line and offline wait times is effective.|Vasiliki Kostami| Amy R.

We identify quantity and price responsiveness as two mediating mechanisms that distinguish how high and low inventory turnover retailers manage demand shocks. Using quarterly firm-level data of 183 U.S. retailers between 1985 and 2012, we find that HIT retailers are able to respond quickly by changing their purchase quantities in response to demand shocks, whereas LIT retailers primarily rely on price changes to manage demand shocks. In addition, we examine the differential implications of these mechanisms on the financial performance of HIT and LIT retailers. We find price responsiveness to be a less effective strategy, compared to quantity responsiveness, in reducing excesses and shortages of inventory. Finally, the negative financial impact of a given amount of excess and shortage of inventory is eight times more severe for LIT retailers compared to HIT retailers.|Saravanan Kesavan| Tarun Kushwaha| Vishal Gaur||||||||Kenan-Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599|Kenan-Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599|Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14850||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

unbundling"|We consider a setting where the firm sells a main service (e.g., air travel) and an ancillary service (e.g., in-flight meal) to two types of consumers: high type (e.g., business travelers) and low type (e.g., leisure travelers). The firm decides whether to unbundle the ancillary service from the main service and charge separate prices for different service components. We study the interaction between the optimal ancillary unbundling strategy and the firm’s use of main service price discrimination by analyzing two types of firms: firms that use uniform pricing of main service and firms that use discriminatory pricing of main service. We find that a uniform-pricing (respectively, discriminatory-pricing) firm should unbundle the ancillary service if the fraction of high-type consumers who value the ancillary service is large (respectively, small) enough. The difference hinges on the rationale that under uniform pricing, unbundling allows the firm to extract more ancillary surplus from high-type consumers; by contrast, under discriminatory pricing, bundling allows the firm to extract more ancillary surplus from consumers. Moreover, we find that unbundling the ancillary service and using main service price discrimination are strategic complements (respectively, strategic substitutes) if the correlation between consumers’ main service valuations and ancillary service valuations is low (respectively, high).|Yao Cui | Izak Duenyas | Ozge Sahin ||||||||Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853|Stephen M.

This paper fills the literature gap by comparing buyer finance with bank finance in a supply chain with one assembler and multiple heterogeneous capital-constrained component suppliers. We characterize the equilibrium solutions for different financing schemes (i.e., buyer finance, bank finance, and no finance). We show that in buyer finance the assembler should charge the suppliers the lowest possible interest rate, which may be even below its own unit capital opportunity cost, leading to interest losses in financing suppliers. However, the assembler can benefit more from enhanced inventory backup and lower component purchasing prices resulting from the low buyer-finance interest rate. We further compare the two financing schemes from the perspectives of the assembler, the borrowing and nonborrowing suppliers, and the whole supply chain. Our analysis reveals that the assembler may offer buyer finance even if its own unit capital opportunity cost is higher than the bank risk-free interest rate. We also demonstrate how the suppliers’ initial capitals, production costs, and their heterogeneities affect the assembler’s selection of the optimal financing scheme and identify the conditions under which buyer finance is better than bank finance for different parties in this assembly supply chain.|Shiming Deng | Chaocheng Gu | Gangshu (George) Cai| Yanhai Li|||||||School of Management, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China|Department of Administrative Management, Jinan University, Guangzhou 510632, China|Leavey School of Business, Santa Clara University, Santa Clara, California 95053|School of Management, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, Wuhan 430074, China|||||||CHINA|CHINA|USA|CHINA||||||

We first show that the problem is polynomially solvable and then develop several insights into the behavior of such systems and identify strategies for effectively managing them. A key driver for the extent of substitution is the ratio of changeover cost to the substitution cost associated with mean demand. The interaction between changeovers and substitution is most prominent when this ratio is neither too high nor too low. Furthermore, the value of this ratio also influences the length of an appropriate rolling horizon; an increase in the value of the ratio signals an increase in the length of a near-optimal rolling horizon. We identify a complementary relationship between substitution and changeover costs: When the changeover cost is large, it is better to invest in reducing the substitution cost and vice versa. As the holding cost of the substitutable product increases, substitution is (respectively, changeovers are) utilized more when the changeover (respectively, substitution) cost is large.|Milind Dawande| Srinagesh Gavirneni| Yinping Mu| Suresh Sethi| Chelliah Sriskandarajah||||||School of Management, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75080|Johnson School, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853|School of Economics and Management, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China 610054|School of Management, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75080|School of Management, University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas 75080||||||USA|USA|CHINA|USA|USA|||||

Furthermore, whereas the value of product flexibility always decreases in demand correlation, we show that the value of volume flexibility can increase or decrease in demand correlation depending on whether the products are strategic complements or substitutes. We further find that volume flexibility better combats aggregate demand uncertainty for the two products, whereas product flexibility is better at mitigating individual demand uncertainty for each product. Our results thus underscore the necessity of analyzing volume flexibility with more than one product and emphasize the contrast with product flexibility. Furthermore, we highlight the possible pitfalls of combining flexibilities: we show that although adding volume flexibility to product flexibility never hurts performance, adding product flexibility to volume flexibility is not always beneficial, even when such an addition is costless.|Manu Goyal| Serguei Netessine|||||||||David Eccles School of Business, University of Utah, Salt Lake City, Utah 84112|INSEAD, 77305 Fontainebleau, France|||||||||USA|FRANCE||||||||

We present structural results that characterize the interaction between the decision to hold a sale and the inventory-ordering decision. We show that the optimal inventory-ordering policy is a state-dependent base-stock policy; however, the optimal pricing policy can be quite complicated due to both the value and the cost of holding inventory and delaying sales. In our computational analysis, we find that compared to a fixed-price policy, we see an average gain in profit of almost 5% from optimally varying promotion and inventory decisions accounting for intertemporal demand, and we find that this potential profit gain increases as demand variability decreases.

We develop an extension of a resource allocation and pricing mechanism for an M/M/1 system. In contrast to the system without the QoS guarantee, where a fixed priority scheduling policy—known as the cμ rule—is optimal, we show that the system may need to adopt a more general randomized priority scheduling policy to maximize the overall system profit. We also develop a transfer pricing scheme that is both optimal and incentive compatible, allowing users to act in their self-interests while collectively achieving the system optimum.

The mass customizer (MC) has a perfectly flexible production technology and thus can offer any variety within a product space, represented by Hotelling's linear city. The mass producer (MP) has a more focused production technology and therefore offers a finite set of products in the same space. The MP can invest in more flexible technology, which reduces its cost of variety and hence allows it to offer a larger set of products; in the extreme, the MP can emulate the MC's technology and offer infinite variety. The firms simultaneously decide whether to enter the market, and the MP chooses its degree of product-mix flexibility on entry. Next, the MP designs its product line—i.e., the number and position of its products—the MC's perfectly flexible technology makes this unnecessary. Finally, both firms simultaneously set prices. We analyze the subgame-perfect Nash equilibrium in this three-stage game, allowing firm-specific fixed and variable costs that together characterize their production technology. We find that an MP facing competition from an MC offers lower product variety than an MP monopolist to reduce the intensity of price competition. We also find that the MP can survive this competition, even if it has higher fixed cost of production technology, higher marginal cost of production, or both.|Aydın Alptekinoğlu| Charles J.

Past evidence suggests that the committee could use a more systematic approach to incorporate observed information and to quantify the risks associated with different options. There are two key trade-offs involved in this decision. First, if the Committee decides to retain the current vaccine composition instead of updating to a new one, there is lower uncertainty in production yields, but the current vaccine could be less effective if a new virus strain spreads. Second, if the Committee decides early with less information, then manufacturers have more production time, but the reduced information increases the risk of choosing a wrong strain. We derive an optimal dynamic policy for this decision. Because of the greater uncertainty in production yields of new vaccines, the optimal thresholds are neither symmetric between retaining and updating the composition nor monotonic over time. We apply our model to past decisions using parameter values estimated from a historical case. Our analysis shows that the dynamic optimal policy can significantly improve social welfare.|Soo-Haeng Cho||||||||||Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213||||||||||USA|||||||||

Focusing on scarce products, we constructed and experimentally tested a two-stage model in which a firm sells a seasonal good under exogenous inventory constraints to a market of strategic buyers. In our experiment, subjects assigned the role of buyers made purchase decisions in response to prices set by an automated seller. We find that equilibrium predictions assuming fully strategic buyers largely accounted for aggregate behavior in the experiment, and the ex post optimal decisions for subjects were overwhelmingly consistent with equilibrium prescriptions. Moreover, subjects tended to become individually more strategic as the session progressed. However, there were also nuanced systematic patterns of deviations from equilibrium that had profit and pricing implications for the seller. First, a nonnegligible minority of subjects exhibited completely myopic buying behavior even with practice. Second, when the product was relatively more scarce, myopic buying had a stronger impact on demand at higher prices; the upshot is that the seller's season-profit-maximizing price could be considerably higher than what would be optimal with fully strategic buyers.|Vincent Mak| Amnon Rapoport| Eyran J.

This paper presents a methodology for determining which versions of a set of related components should be offered to optimally support a defined finished product portfolio. We develop optimization models that determine which versions of each component should be introduced and which of these versions each product should use to minimize design and production costs. This approach is appropriate for components with a relatively low impact on consumers’ perceptions about product differentiation, which can be shared across a set of products if they meet the most stringent performance requirements in the set. We illustrate our procedure on automotive braking systems, but also discuss its applicability to other components and industries. We identify three conceptually different organizational approaches to component sharing: a coordinated projects approach that requires higher-level organizational echelons above the individual project, a project-by-project approach that does not, and a hybrid partially coordinated approach. We use our model to examine how the gain from the coordinated projects approach relative to the project-by-project approach varies with the number of component versions in consideration, warranty costs, complexity costs, and demand variability. Further, we use our model to highlight the risk of using simplistic heuristics to determine design sequence within a component system in a partially coordinated approach.|Kamalini Ramdas| Marshall Fisher| Karl Ulrich||||||||Darden Graduate School of Business, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22906|The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6302|The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104-6302||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

We use a multiperiod stochastic inventory model with financial constraints and demonstrate that despite the funding complexities, the optimal replenishment policy is a state-independent policy that can be easily implemented. We also provide analytical results and several insights based on our computational study regarding the effect of funding timing uncertainty and variability on the operating costs and fill rates. Among other results, we find that receiving funding early is beneficial in underfinanced systems while avoiding funding delays is critical in fully financed systems. Our analysis also indicates that receiving less overall funding in a timely manner might actually be better than delayed full funding.|Karthik V. Natarajan| Jayashankar M.

We carry the analysis in terms of a simplified model which entails N retailers who face stochastic demands and hold stocks locally and/or at one or more central locations. An exogenously specified fraction of any unsatisfied demand (demand greater than locally available stock) at a retailer could be satisfied using excess stocks at other retailers and/or stocks held at a central location. We consider inventory ordering and allocation decisions. The operational decisions of inventory and allocation of stocks and the financial decision of allocation of revenues/costs must be made in a way consistent with the individual incentives of the various independent retailers. We develop a “coopetitive” framework for the sequential decisions of inventory and allocation. We introduce the notion of claims that allows us to separate the ownership (with decision rights) and the location of inventories in the system. For the cooperative shipping and allocation decision, we use the concept of core and develop sufficient conditions for the existence of the core. For the inventory decision, we develop conditions for the existence of a pure strategy Nash Equilibrium. For this decentralized system, we show that there exists an allocation mechanism that achieves the first-best solution for inventory deployment and allocation. We develop conditions under which the first-best equilibrium will be unique. Our model can be easily generalized to include complicated ownership structures such as “super dealers,” partnerships, “inventory speculators,” and situations in retail e-commerce settings such as “click-through arrangements,” separation of “demand generators,” and “fulfillment houses,” etc. It can also be applied to situations involving capacity allocations and product substitutions.|Ravi Anupindi| Yehuda Bassok| Eitan Zemel||||||||Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, New York 10012|Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089|Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, New York 10012||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

In particular, for uniformly distributed customer valuations, under a large set of parameters, we find that demand-independent prices can capture more than 99% of the optimal revenue.

Introducing cross-sales to a service center, however, needs to be properly managed as it could degrade customer service quality. Real-time customer and system information can be used to set the appropriate control policy for cross-sales to enhance profitability without causing undesirable service degradation for calling customers. The objective of this paper is to illustrate the value of using real-time information in selecting optimal control policies for cross-sales in telephone service centers. Specifically, we develop an introductory mathematical model to incorporate the use of two types of information, system status (queuing congestion) and customer profile (likelihood of purchase) in determining the optimal control policy to maximize the expected operating profit of the system. We hope to stimulate further research in this area by providing a groundwork for further modeling. We show that using more information increases a call center’s operating profit.

We study systems that can be modeled by single-machine scheduling problems with due date assignment and controllable job-processing times, which are either linear or convex functions of the amount of a continuously divisible and nonrenewable resource that is allocated to the task. The due date assignment methods studied include the common due date, the slack due date, which reflects equal waiting time allowance for the jobs, and the most general method of unrestricted due dates, when each job may be assigned a different due date. For each combination of due date assignment method and processing-time function, we provide a polynomial-time algorithm to find the optimal job sequence, due date values, and resource allocations that minimize an integrated objective function, which includes the weighted number of tardy jobs, and due date assignment, makespan, and total resource consumption costs.|Dvir Shabtay| George Steiner|||||||||Management Science and Information Systems Area, Michael G.

We find that suppliers with smaller market share are associated with more trade credit, confirming that suppliers with weak market power use trade credit as a competitive tool. Next, we find that buyers with larger market share are associated with more trade credit, whereas suppliers selling to a concentrated buyer base are associated with less trade credit; by differentiating competition in buyers’ markets from competition between supply chain partners, we show that the two types of competition have different impacts on trade credit. In studying the impact of trade credit on firm performance, we make the distinction between an industry-average trade credit and an individual supply chain’s deviation from such an industry average. When suppliers offer trade credit at their industry-average level, this action facilitates trade and, thus, is positively associated with both parties’ performance; conversely, when suppliers are more aggressive in their trade credit strategy than the industry average, then the excess trade credit is negatively associated with buyer performance. One managerial message from our research is that buyers should be cautious about trade credit far exceeding the industry-average level.|Hsiao-Hui Lee | Jianer Zhou| Jingqi Wang||||||||Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong|Accenture, Boston, Massachusetts 02199|Faculty of Business and Economics, University of Hong Kong, Pokfulam, Hong Kong||||||||HONG KONG|USA|HONG KONG|||||||

A pervasive but implicit assumption in the literature is that a firm knows its suppliers' yield distributions with certainty. This is a strong assumption in many circumstances. A firm is more likely to have a forecast of a supplier's yield distribution and to update that forecast based on its experiences with the supplier. We introduce and analyze a Bayesian model of “supply learning” (i.e., distribution updating) and investigate how supply learning influences both sourcing and inventory strategies in dual-sourcing and single-sourcing models, respectively. In the case of Bernoulli all-or-nothing yield distributions, we completely characterize the firm's optimal sourcing and inventory decisions for the supply-learning model. Among other results, we prove that for a given expected supplier reliability (i.e., the mean of the firm's forecast for the probability of successful delivery) an increase in the reliability forecast uncertainty increases the attractiveness of a supplier, but it reduces the firm's desire to invest in inventory to protect against future supply failures. We extend our analysis to allow for general yield distributions, multiple sourcing (i.e., more than two suppliers), and inventory carryover in the dual-sourcing model.|Brian Tomlin||||||||||Kenan-Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 25799||||||||||USA|||||||||

Specifically using a two-period model with correlated demand, we illustrate how options provide flexibility to a buyer to respond to market changes in the second period. We also study the implications of such arrangements between a buyer and a supplier for coordination of the channel. We show that, in general, channel coordination can be achieved only if we allow the exercise price to be piecewise linear. We develop sufficient conditions on the cost parameters such that linear prices coordinate the channel. We derive the appropriate prices for channel coordination which, however, violate the individual rationality constraint for the supplier. Contrary to popular belief (based on simpler models) we show that credit for returns offered by the supplier does not always coordinate the channel and alleviate the individual rationality constraint. Credit for returns are useful only on a subset of the feasibility region under which channel coordination is achievable with linear prices. Finally, we demonstrate (numerically) the benefits of options in improving channel performance and evaluate the magnitude of loss due to lack of coordination.|Dawn Barnes-Schuster| Yehuda Bassok| Ravi Anupindi||||||||Ro¨telsteig 9, CH-8037 Zu¨rich|Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089|Stern School of Business, New York University, New York, New York 10012||||||||SWITZERLAND|USA|USA|||||||

Using a scenario-based modeling approach, the objective of this formulation is to maximize the expected profit associated with the OT schedule. Since the complexity of the problem is NP-hard, we develop a two-step, heuristic solution approach that allows us to solve practical-sized instances in reasonable time. Experimentation shows that incorporating uncertainty via scenarios increases profit and OT utilization when compared to deterministic scheduling methods. Moreover, explicitly considering urgent arrivals results in a significant reduction in the time that patients of this type wait to receive service, with little impact on other key metrics.|Nickolas K.

Shang|Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708|multiechelon; single-stage heuristic; nonstationary demand; myopic solution|Companies often face nonstationary demand due to product life cycles and seasonality, and nonstationary demand complicates supply chain managers' inventory decisions. This paper proposes a simple heuristic for determining stocking levels in a serial inventory system. Unlike the exact optimization algorithm, the heuristic generates a near-optimal solution by solving a series of independent single-stage systems. The heuristic is constructed based on three results we derive. First, we provide a new cost decomposition scheme based on echelon systems. Next, we show that the optimal base-stock level for each echelon system is bounded by those of two revised echelon systems. Last, we prove that the revised echelon systems are essentially equivalent to single-stage systems. We examine the myopic solution for these single-stage systems. In a numerical study, we find that the change of direction of the myopic solution is consistent with that of the optimal solution when system parameters vary. We then derive an analytical expression for the myopic solution and use it to gain insights into how to manage inventory. The analytical expression shows how future demand affects the current optimal local base-stock level; it also explains an observation that the safety stock at an upstream stage is often stable and may not increase when the demand variability increases over time. Finally, we discuss how the heuristic leads to a time-consistent coordination scheme that enables a decentralized supply chain to achieve the heuristic solution.|Kevin H.

We apply our metric to an automotive manufacturing sample comprising 162 car models and find 75% smooth production by at least 5%, despite the fact that 99% exhibit the bullwhip effect. Indeed, we estimate both a strong bullwhip (on average, production is 220% as variable as sales) and robust smoothing (on average, production would be 22% more variable without deliberate stabilization).

In this paper, we empirically investigate how well these choice rules match actual performance as people solve two-armed Bernoulli bandit problems.

Procurement auctions create supply chain efficiencies by selecting the least costly bidder, and long-term relational contracts ensure the quality of the procured products or services when these have nonverifiable attributes. The following two-layer supply chain model is analyzed: Suppliers of an industrial part with nonverifiable quality trade with several manufacturers that utilize that part in the production of an end product. A price-based reverse auction is used for the procurement of low-quality parts, and a relational long-term contract is used for high-quality parts. A formal model of the competition between the two procurement models identifies conditions under which the two coexist, and conditions under which one will push the other out of the market. Market and product parameters that increase the relative economic appeal of the relational contract are determined. It is demonstrated that the competition from the auction market can either facilitate or undermine the relational contract compared with a benchmark case of a monopolist supplier. This implies that competition between the two procurement models plays an important role in the supply of high-quality products.|Tunay I. Tunca| Stefanos A.

Bidding behavior is specified and proven to induce a Bayesian Nash equilibrium, and a closed-form expression for the expected revenue of each auctioneer is derived. For auctioneers selling a single item, partial pooling—i.e., the presence of some cross-auction bidders—is beneficial to both auctioneers as long as neither one dominates the market (e.g., possesses more than 60%–65% of the market share). For multi-item auctions, pooling is mutually beneficial only if both auctioneers have nearly identical ratios of bidders per items for sale; otherwise, only the auctioneer with the smaller ratio benefits from pooling. Pooling's impact on revenue decreases with the number of bidders, suggesting that popular auction sites need not be overly concerned with mitigating bidding across auctions.|Damian R.

Recursive and explicit expressions for the performance measures of interest are derived based on the random evolution of the system’s workload in transient state. We prove discrete convexity properties of the optimization problem that restrict our search to a contained solution space and guarantee that a local search algorithm terminates with a globally optimal schedule.

resource allocation"|Rapidly evolving infectious disease epidemics, such as the 2014 West African Ebola outbreak, pose significant health threats and present challenges to the global health community because of their heterogeneous geographic spread. Policy makers must allocate limited intervention resources quickly, in anticipation of where the outbreak is moving next. We develop a two-stage model for optimizing when and where to assign Ebola treatment units across geographic regions during the outbreak’s early phases. The first stage employs a novel dynamic transmission model to forecast the occurrence of new cases at the region level, capturing connectivity among regions. We introduce an empirically estimated coefficient for behavioral adaptation to changing epidemic conditions. The second stage compares four approaches to allocate units across affected regions: (i) a heuristic based on observed cases, (ii) a greedy policy that prioritizes regions based on the reproductive number, (iii) a myopic linear program that allocates resources in the next period based on an iterative estimation–optimization approach coupled with the underlying epidemic model, and (iv) an approximate dynamic programming algorithm that optimizes over all future periods. After testing the allocation schemes under different budgets and time periods, we find that the myopic policy performs best, even when limited data are available. Our methodology could be generalized to other disease outbreaks, including the Zika virus, and other interventions.|Elisa F.

A key insight is that the transshipment price determines whether the firms benefit from, or are hurt by, transshipment. In particular, we show that the manufacturer prefers to set the transshipment price as high as possible, whereas retailers prefer a lower transshipment price. Given the important role of the transshipment price in determining the benefits that each firm gets from transshipment, it is useful to consider transshipment in the case where retailers are under joint ownership (a “chain store”) and the transshipment price does not play a role. This comparison yields two surprising results. First, if decentralized retailers control the transshipment price, they will choose a relatively low transshipment price as a way to mitigate the manufacturer's ability to extract profits by increasing wholesale prices; therefore, the manufacturer may prefer dealing with the chain store, which does not have a transshipment price, rather than with decentralized retailers. Similarly, the decentralized retailers can use a low transshipment price to achieve higher total profits than a chain store.|Jing Shao| Harish Krishnan| S.

We develop an analytical framework to evaluate four major supply chain structures that we observed in practice. We derive the optimal supply chain decisions for each structure and investigate various business environments under which one of the structures is preferred over the others. Our analysis indicates that the ultimate purpose of a product sold in the China market (i.e., whether it will be consumed domestically or be assembled in another exported product) may have a significant impact on the structure preference. In addition, threshold values exist for several key business parameters over (or under) which certain supply chain structures are favored over others. Managerial insights based on such results are useful for multinational firms who are challenged to develop effective supply chain strategies in the region's increasingly volatile business environment.|Vernon N.

The literature only considers the issue of revenue generation in a very limited way, by allowing a job to remain unprocessed and its revenue contribution to be lost. By contrast, we consider three diverse practical situations where efficient scheduling affects revenue in much more general and realistic ways. First, we study two make-to-order environments where efficient scheduling increases customer goodwill, thus stimulating demand in different ways. Second, we study two make-to-stock environments where efficient scheduling creates inventory, thus also stimulating demand in different ways. Third, we study new product markets where efficient scheduling leads to a company becoming the first mover, and thus acquiring a larger market share. In each case, we provide both a computationally efficient algorithm for scheduling and a proof that a much more efficient algorithm is unlikely to exist. For both the make-to-stock and make-to-order problems, we also describe heuristic approaches that are easy to implement, and we study their average performance. The results show that substantial benefits arise from considering the implications of efficient scheduling for revenue and net profit. The practical impact of our work is to demonstrate the importance of efficient scheduling, not only in controlling cost, but also in increasing revenue and net profit.|Zhi-Long Chen| Nicholas G.

Specifically, we consider a firm that must choose capacities of resources that will be used to satisfy stochastic demand for multiple products, where demands follow a multivariate normal distribution. Prior to the capacity decision, the firm receives information revealing either the total volume of demand across products or the mix of demand between products. We examine two different scenarios: a dedicated resource setting with product-specific resources and a common resource scenario with one flexible resource. For both scenarios we derive the distribution of the (possibly imperfect) volume or mix demand signal, as well as the conditional distributions of demand given the particular signal. We explore the impact of either type of information on optimal capacities and profit. We find that commonality and volume information are strategic complements—so that it is more valuable to obtain volume information in settings with a common resource. On the other hand, commonality and mix information are strategic substitutes. Moreover, we find that mix and volume information themselves are complements in systems with dedicated resources. Having either type of information is valuable in reducing uncertainty for each individual product demand, but having both of them together provides information on two different dimensions, allowing for a much greater reduction in demand uncertainty. In systems with a common resource, however, the two types of information are substitutes. Because volume information is well aligned with commonality (both focus on total demand), such information already provides much of the value that can be obtained—having mix information adds limited additional value.|Fernando Bernstein| Gregory A.

Logistics service providers as well as local governments are in need of evaluating the potentially substantial impacts of this mode shift, given their economic objectives and environmental concerns. This paper addresses this need by providing new logistics planning models and managerial insights. These models characterize open-loop car routes, car drivers’ wage-response behavior, interplay with the ride-share market, and optimal sizes of service zones within which passenger vehicles pick up goods and fulfill the last-mile delivery. Based on theoretical analysis and empirical estimates in a realistic setting, the findings suggest that crowdsourcing shared mobility is not as scalable as the conventional truck-only system in terms of the operating cost. However, a transition to this paradigm has the potential for creating economic benefits by reducing the truck fleet size and exploiting additional operational flexibilities (e.g., avoiding high-demand areas and peak hours, adjusting vehicle loading capacities, etc.). These insights are insignificantly affected by the dynamic adjustment of wages and prices of the ride-share market. If entering into this paradigm, greenhouse gas emissions may increase because of prolonged car trip distance; on the other hand, even exclusively minimizing operating costs incurs only slightly more emissions than exclusively minimizing emissions.|Wei Qi | Lefei Li| Sheng Liu | Zuo-Jun Max Shen |||||||Desautels Faculty of Management, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada H3A 1G5；|Department of Industrial Engineering, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China；|Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720|Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720; d Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720|||||||CANADA|CHINA|USA|USA||||||

Common credit terms are tantamount to a schedule of declining discounts (escalating penalties) that depend on how long the retailer takes to pay off the supplier's loan. However, issues such as which stocking policies are optimal in the presence of supplier-provided credit have been investigated only when demand is assumed deterministic. Nearly all stochastic inventory models assume either time-invariant finance charges or charges that may vary with time but not with the age of the credit. In this article we present a discrete time model of the retailer's operations with random demand, which is used to prove that the structure of the optimal policy is not affected by credit terms, although the value of the optimal policy parameter is. This is followed by a continuous time model, which leads to an algorithm for finding the optimal stock level.

Thus, quantity–payment contracts that implement the optimal mechanisms are contingent across suppliers (i.e., each supplier’s contract terms contain other suppliers’ private costs as variables), making the implementation impractical. To address this issue, we propose alternative implementations of the optimal mechanisms by menus of two-part tariff contracts that are noncontingent. In addition, optimal simultaneous and sequential procurement mechanisms for assembly are shown to be revenue-equivalent for all parties despite their different asymmetric information structures.

In addition to stochastic demand for finished products, the system experiences stochastic returns of subsets of components, which can then be used to satisfy subsequent demands. The system is managed over an infinite horizon using a component-level base-stock policy. We identify several ways in which returns complicate the behavior of the system, and we demonstrate how to handle these additional complexities when calculating or approximating key order-based performance metrics, including the immediate fill rate, the fill rate within a time window, and average backorders. We also present a method for computing a near-optimal base-stock policy. We use these results to address managerial questions on both operational and product-design levels.

We consider a two-stage supply chain with a single supplier selling its product to consumers through a single retailer. We assume that both the supplier and the retailer can improve the quality of their demand forecasts by making costly forecasting investments to gather and analyze information. First, we consider a noncollaborative model where the supplier and the retailer can invest in forecasting but do not share forecast information. Next, we examine a collaborative forecasting model where the supplier and the retailer combine their information to form a single shared demand forecast. We investigate the value of CF by comparing each party's profits in these scenarios under three contractual forms that are widely used in practice (two variations of the simple wholesale price contract as well as the buyback contract). We show that for a given set of parameters, CF may be Pareto improving for none to all three of the contractual structures, and that the Pareto regions under all three contractual structures can be expressed with a unifying expression that admits an intuitive interpretation. We observe that these regions are limited and explain how they are shaped by the contractual structure, power balance, and relative forecasting capability of the parties. To determine the specific value of collaborative forecasting as a function of different factors, we carry out a numerical analysis and observe the following. First, under noncoordinating contracts, improved information as a result of CF has the added benefit of countering the adverse effects of double marginalization in addition to reducing the cost of supply–demand mismatch. Second, one may expect the value of CF to increase with bargaining power, however this does not hold in general: The value of CF for the newsvendor first increases and then decreases in his bargaining power. Finally, whereas one may expect CF to be more valuable under coordinating contracts, rather than a simple wholesale price contract that is prone to double marginalization, the magnitude of the gain from CF is in many cases higher in the absence of quantity coordination.|Mümin Kurtuluş| Sezer Ülkü| Beril L.

Inflexible generators commit production before uncertainties are realized, whereas flexible generators can adjust their production after uncertainties are realized. Both types of generators compete in an electricity market by submitting supply functions to a system operator, who solves a two-stage stochastic program to determine the production level for each generator and the corresponding market prices. We aim to gain an understanding of how conventional generators’ (in)flexibility and renewable energy’s intermittency affect the supply function competition and the market price. We find that the classic supply function equilibrium model overestimates the intensity of the market competition, and even more so when more intermittent generation is introduced into the system. The policy of economically curtailing intermittent generation intensifies the market competition, reduces price volatility, and improves the system’s overall efficiency. Furthermore, these benefits of economic curtailment are most significant when the production-based subsidies for renewable energy are absent.|Majid Al-Gwaiz| Xiuli Chao| Owen Q.

This problem is similar to the classic newsvendor problem, except: (a) the distribution of demand is a function of the selling price, which is determined by the retailer; and (b) the objective of the retailer is to maximize his/her expected utility. We consider two different ways in which price affects the distribution of demand. In the first model, we assume that a change in price affects the scale of the distribution. In the second model, a change in price only affects the location of the distribution. We present methodology by which this problem with two decision variables can be simplified by reducing it to a problem in a single variable. We show that in comparison to a risk-neutral retailer, a risk-averse retailer in the first model will charge a higher price and order less; where as, in the second model a risk-averse retailer will charge a lower price. The implications of these findings for supply-chain strategy and channel design are discussed. Our research provides a better understanding of retailers' pricing behavior that could lead to improved price contracts and channel-management policies.|Vipul Agrawal| Sridhar Seshadri|||||||||Operations Management Department, Leonard N.

Information sharing allows a manufacturer’s wholesale price to respond to demand signal, which benefits the supply chain if the manufacturer is efficient in cost reduction and hurts it otherwise. It also allows a manufacturer’s cost reduction level to respond to demand signal, which always benefits the supply chain. A supply chain that engages in information sharing triggers a reaction from the rival chain. Such a reaction may benefit or hurt the first supply chain, depending on whether the retailers compete on quantity or price, and whether or not the manufacturers are efficient in cost reduction. With quantity competition, information sharing occurs when the manufacturers are efficient in cost reduction. It is more likely to occur when either information is less accurate or competition is less intense. With price competition, information sharing occurs when either competition is intense or the manufacturers are efficient in cost reduction. It is more likely to occur when information is more accurate. When information sharing is beneficial to a supply chain, a manufacturer can buy information from a retailer with a side payment, which is zero if the manufacturer is sufficiently efficient in cost reduction.|Albert Y.

Motivated by a building-products retailer's practice of stocking large quantities of products to stimulate demand, we study inventory management and pricing policies when demand is uncertain but increases with stocking quantity. We first characterize the profit-maximization policy for a stochastic inventory model with a general inventory-dependent demand distribution and given price, and show that demand stimulation (by inventories) has the effect of increasing the target service level beyond the classical newsvendor model's critical fractile ratio. To underscore the importance of considering both demand stochasticity and inventory influence, we consider two functionally oriented benchmark policies—a demand-driven policy and a critical fractile policy—that might, respectively, represent marketing and inventory managers' viewpoints. Our numerical analysis reveals that the optimal policy can generate considerably higher profits than the two complementary functional perspectives. Moreover, we prove that the optimal stocking quantity always exceeds the critical fractile solution and can even exceed the demand-driven stocking quantity. We also address the problem of jointly optimizing both stocking quantity and price for demand-stimulating products using a multiplicative model to represent the influence of price and stocking quantity on the demand distribution. For this model, we show that the pricing and stocking decisions can be determined sequentially, with the optimal policy setting higher prices and stock levels than both the functional policies.|Anantaram Balakrishnan| Michael S.

Because products are returned under different operational conditions, they usually require different remanufacturing effort/costs. Motivated by a project with a major energy company that manages its inventory through options of ordering and remanufacturing returned products (cores) in various condition, in this paper, we study a single-product, periodic-review inventory system with multiple types of cores. The serviceable products used to fulfill stochastic customer demand can be either manufactured from new parts or remanufactured from the cores, and the objective is to minimize the expected total discounted cost over a finite planning horizon. We show that the optimal manufacturing–remanufacturing–disposal policy has a simple structure and can be completely characterized by a sequence of constant control parameters when manufacturing and remanufacturing leadtimes are the same. To demonstrate the value of the optimal policy, we conduct a numerical study that compares its performance with two simple heuristics, namely, pull policy without and with sorting. The results show that the reduction in system cost by using the optimal policy can be significant. When manufacturing and remanufacturing leadtimes are different, we develop a heuristic method for computing the near-optimal control policy that performs quite well as demonstrated numerically.|Sean X.

It describes how demand variance amplifies from a downstream site to an upstream site due to demand information distortion. Two different bullwhip effect measures have been used in the literature. Theorists analyze the bullwhip effect based on the information flow (i.e., order and demand information), whereas most empiricists measure it according to the material flow (i.e., shipment and sales data). It is unclear how much the discrepancy between these two measures is, and, if significant, how to reconcile the discrepancy. In this paper, we illustrate and quantify the discrepancy under three inventory systems. For the system with stationary demand and ample supply, we show that the bullwhip effect measure based on the material-flow data is always greater than that based on the information flow. For the system with correlated demand and for the system with supply shortages, we derive conditions under which the material flow measure is either greater or less than the information flow measure. We find that the discrepancy is driven by four factors: stocking level, lead time, demand correlation, and supply service level. We further propose a method to reduce the discrepancy by using the sample variances of aggregated sales data. Our method works for common demand processes with short-range dependence, and it does not require the knowledge of the underlying base-stock levels.|Li Chen| Wei Luo| Kevin Shang||||||||Samuel Curtis Johnson Graduate School of Management, Cornell University, Ithaca, New York 14853|IESE Business School, University of Navarra, 08034 Barcelona, Spain|Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708||||||||USA|SPAIN|USA|||||||

Commonality always leads to increased profits, but its effect on the level of product variety depends on the type of commonality. If all common components are used for the production of the entire set of products, then the optimal variety level increases relative to the system with no commonality. However, if the common components are used by a subset of the final products, then the optimal variety level may decrease with commonality.

The retailer carries finished goods inventory to service a Poisson demand process, and specifies a policy for replenishing his inventory from an upstream supplier. The supplier chooses the service rate, i.e., the capacity of his manufacturing facility, which behaves as a single-server queue with exponential service times. Demand is backlogged and both agents share the backorder cost. In addition, a linear inventory holding cost is charged to the retailer, and a linear cost for building production capacity is incurred by the supplier. The inventory level, demand rate, and cost parameters are common knowledge to both agents. Under the continuous-state approximation where the M/M/1 queue has an exponential rather than geometric steady-state distribution, we characterize the optimal centralized and Nash solutions, and show that a contract with linear transfer payments replicates a cost-sharing agreement and coordinates the system. We also compare the total system costs, the agents' decision variables, and the customer service levels of the centralized versus Nash versus Stackelberg solutions.|René Caldentey| Lawrence M.

The first, purchase order financing (POF), allows financial institutions to offer loans to suppliers by considering the value of purchase orders issued by reputable buyers. Under the second, which we call buyer direct financing (BDF), manufacturers issue both sourcing contracts and loans directly to suppliers. Both schemes are closely related to the supplier’s performance risk (whether the supplier can deliver the order successfully), upon which the repayment of these loans hinges. To understand the relative efficiency of the two emerging schemes, we analyze a game-theoretical model that captures the interactions among three parties (a manufacturer, a financially constrained supplier who can exert unobservable effort to improve delivery reliability, and a bank). We find that, when the manufacturer and the bank have symmetric information, POF and BDF yield the same payoffs for all parties irrespective of the manufacturer’s control advantage under BDF. The manufacturer, however, has more flexibility under BDF in selecting contract terms. In addition, even when the manufacturer has superior information about the supplier’s operational capability, the manufacturer can efficiently signal her private information via the sourcing contract if the supplier’s asset level is not too low. As such, POF remains an attractive financing option. However, if the supplier is severely financially constrained, the manufacturer’s information advantage makes BDF the preferred financing scheme when contracting with an efficient supplier. In particular, the relative benefit of BDF (over POF) is more pronounced when the supply market contains a larger proportion of inefficient suppliers, when differences in efficiency between suppliers are greater, or when the manufacturer’s alternative sourcing option is more expensive.|Christopher S.

Customers in each class are inherently heterogeneous in their willingness to pay for service, but their utilities are also affected by the presence of other customers in the system. Specifically, customer utilities depend on how many customers are in the system at the time of service as well as who these other customers are. We find that if the service provider can price discriminate between customer classes, pricing out a class, i.e., operating an exclusive system, can sometimes be optimal and depends only on classes’ perceptions of each other. If the provider must charge a single price, an exclusive system is even more likely. We extend our analysis to a service provider who can prevent class interaction by allocating separate capacity segments to the two customer classes. Under price discrimination, allocating capacity is optimal if the “net appreciation” between classes, as defined in the paper, is negative. However, under a single-price policy, allocating capacity can be optimal even if this net appreciation is positive.

The goal of our research is to build a unified performance-based contracting (PBC) framework that incorporates patient access-to-care requirements and that explicitly accounts for the complex outpatient care dynamics facilitated by the use of an online appointment scheduling system. We address the optimal contracting problem in a principal–agent framework where a service purchaser (the principal) minimizes her cost of purchasing the services and achieves the performance target (a waiting-time target) while taking into account the response of the provider (the agent) to the contract terms. Given the incentives offered by the contract, the provider maximizes his payoff by allocating his outpatient service capacity among three patient groups: urgent patients, dedicated advance patients, and flexible advance patients. We model the appointment dynamics as that of an M/D/1 queue and analyze several contracting approaches under adverse selection (asymmetric information) and moral hazard (private actions) settings. Our results show that simple and popular schemes used in practice cannot implement the first-best solution and that the linear performance-based contract cannot implement the second-best solution. To overcome these limitations, we propose a threshold-penalty PBC approach and show that it coordinates the system for an arbitrary patient mix and that it achieves the second-best performance for the setting where all advance patients are dedicated.|Houyuan Jiang| Zhan Pang| Sergei Savin||||||||Judge Business School, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1AG, United Kingdom|Lancaster University Management School, Lancaster LA1 4YW, United Kingdom|The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104||||||||UNITED KINGDOM|UNITED KINGDOM|USA|||||||

All other things being equal, is an airline’s expected revenue larger in the market with larger demand? If not, under what circumstances is it possible to compare expected revenues without carrying out a detailed analysis? In this article, we provide answers to these questions by studying the relationship between the optimal expected revenue and the demand distributions when the latter are comparable according to various stochastic orders. For the two-fare class problem with dependent demand we obtain three results. We show that airlines should prefer lesser positive dependence between fare classes when marginal demand distributions are the same. We also describe particular dependence structures under which stochastically larger marginal demand distributions improve optimal expected revenue. Finally, when the dependence between effective demands in the two fare classes arises due to “sell ups,” we show that stochastically larger marginal demand distributions should be preferred. (Sell ups occur when some lower-fare-class customers buy higher-fare tickets upon finding that the former tickets are sold out.) For a problem with an arbitrary number of fare classes and independent demands, we show that stochastically larger demand distributions should be preferred.

We develop our approach in a revenue management setting and apply the test to a data set used to optimize prices for consumer loans. We show that traditional model-based goodness-of-fit tests may consistently reject simple parametric models of consumer response (e.g., the ubiquitous logit model), while at the same time these models may “pass” the proposed performance-based test.

In a short-term profit maximizing setting, our results provide insight for capacity planning decisions upfront and during the broadcasting season.

We first examine the guaranteed-service model for a capacitated single-stage system with bounded demand. We characterize the optimal inventory policy, which depends on the entire demand history. Due to this complexity, we develop a heuristic, namely a constant base-stock policy with censored ordering. This is an order-up-to policy but with its replenishment orders censored by the capacity constraint. We refer to this heuristic as the modified constant base-stock policy (MCBS). We use a numerical experiment to compare the performance of the heuristic policy to the optimal policy. We find that the performance of the heuristic relative to the optimal policy improves with a tighter capacity constraint. We also observe that the performance of the heuristic itself can sometimes be improved by tightening the capacity constraint. We then use the results for a single-stage system to model a multistage serial system that operates with a constant base-stock policy with censored ordering, i.e., an MCBS policy. We show how to adapt the existing dynamic programming algorithm for the unconstrained case to solve for the safety-stock locations and base-stock levels in a capacitated serial system. We describe how to extend this model to other supply chain topologies. We report on numerical tests for serial systems and find that the best MCBS policy in a capacitated system can outperform the best constant base-stock policy in an identical but uncapacitated system.|Stephen C.

To improve consumer welfare and manufacturer profit, many governments launch different types of subsidy programs that offer subsidies to consumers, manufacturers, or both. Motivated by a subsidy program developed by the Chinese government in 2007, we present a parsimonious model to determine the optimal subsidy program in different settings so as to gain a better understanding about the conditions under which it is optimal for the government to subsidize consumers only, manufacturers only, or both. Our analysis reveals that the structure of the optimal subsidy program depends on (a) whether there is a well-established market selling price for the products; and (b) the relative emphasis that the government places on consumer welfare versus manufacturer profit. Also, we find that governments can improve consumer welfare by developing subsidy programs that involve multiple (competing) manufacturers with different market sizes and adequate capacities. Our findings provide insights for developing effective government subsidy programs.|Jiayi Joey Yu | Christopher S.

The supplier reserves the right to assign customers who purchase a flexible product to one of the alternatives at a time near the end of the booking process. An example would be an airline offering a morning flight consisting of specific flights serving the same market. Flexible products are currently offered by a number of industries including air cargo, tour operators, and Internet advertising. Flexible products have the advantage of increasing overall demand and enabling better capacity utilization at the cost of potentially cannibalizing high-fare demand for specific products. This paper introduces the concept of flexible products and derives conditions and algorithms for the management of a single flexible product consisting of two specific products. We use numerical simulation to illustrate the benefits from offering flexible products and discuss extension of the approach to more general settings.|Guillermo Gallego| Robert Phillips|||||||||Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, 326 Mudd Building, New York, New York 10027|Nomis Solutions Inc., 1150 Bayhill Drive, Suite 305, San Bruno, California 94066|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

At the beginning of a planning cycle, the vendor determines a minimum committed order per period. During the cycle, he may also place a supplemental order in each period based on the observed demand signal in that period. Moreover, the vendor is committed to a specific service target evaluated over the planning cycle. This is a complex problem, and we, as an approximation, offer a single-period, two-stage modeling approach. Under this approach, the vendor determines a first-stage order as the minimum committed order with the possibility of supplementing it based on a demand signal observed at the second stage. The problem is to maximize his expected profit subject to a constraint on his overall service performance across all possible values of the demand signal. We characterize the optimal policy for in-stock rate and fill-rate targets, and make comparisons. Whereas in the classical newsvendor model a service target can be replaced by a single unit shortage cost, it is not so in our model. Instead, a set of unit shortage costs are imputed—one for each demand signal. The imputed shortage costs reflect trade-offs among the profits under different demand signals in meeting the service targets. We also show that under a given ordering policy, the in-stock rate is lower (higher) than the fill rate when the demand has an increasing (decreasing) hazard rate. This result suggests that the vendor can infer a fill-rate measure from the corresponding in-stock rate without the difficult task of tracking lost sales. Furthermore, we analyze how the order quantity varies according to the observed signal, which allows us to formalize the notion of a valuable demand signal.|Alain Bensoussan| Qi Feng| Suresh P.

A challenge is how to plan production and inventories to provide the best customer service at the least cost. In this paper, we first describe an application at Teradyne in which we implemented an inventory hedge to protect against cyclic demand variability. Based on this experience, we develop a model to better understand the efficacy of this hedging policy. We consider an inventory system for a single aggregate product with a Markov-modulated Poisson demand process. We provide approximate performance measures for this system and develop an optimization problem for determining the size and location of an intermediate-decoupling inventory.

A newly available server serves the customer from the head of the queue of the class (from among those the server is eligible to serve) whose queue length most exceeds a specified proportion of the total queue length. Under fairly general conditions, QIR produces an important state-space collapse as the total arrival rate and the numbers of servers increase in a coordinated way. That state-space collapse was previously used to delicately balance service levels for the different customer classes. In this sequel, we show that a special version of QIR stochastically minimizes convex holding costs in a finite-horizon setting when the service rates are restricted to be pool dependent. Under additional regularity conditions, the special version of QIR reduces to a simple policy: linear costs produce a priority-type rule, in which the least-cost customers are given low priority. Strictly convex costs (plus other regularity conditions) produce a many-server analogue of the generalized-cμ (Gcμ) rule, under which a newly available server selects a customer from the class experiencing the greatest marginal cost at that time.|Itay Gurvich| Ward Whitt|||||||||Columbia Business School, New York, New York 10027|IEOR Department, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

The contact-center performance may be restricted to a traditional productivity measure such as the number of calls answered per hour, or it may include a broader measure of the quality of service, e.g., revenue earned per hour or the number of problems successfully resolved per hour. The analysis is based on an idealized model of a contact center in which the number of employed agents is constant over time, assuming that a new agent is immediately hired to replace each departing agent. The agent employment periods are assumed to be independent and identically distributed random variables with a general agent-retention probability distribution, which depends on management policy and actions. The steady-state staff-experience distribution is obtained from the agent-retention distribution by applying renewal theory. An increasing real-valued function specifies the average performance as a function of agent experience. Convenient closed-form expressions for the overall performance as a function of model elements are derived when either the agent-retention distribution or the performance function has exponential structure. Management actions may cause the agent-retention distribution to change. The model describes the consequences of such changes on the long-run average staff experience and the long-run average performance.|Ward Whitt||||||||||Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027||||||||||USA|||||||||

We present an exact iterative algorithm for computing the distribution of the number of orders outstanding, and formulae for the inventory shortfall distribution (the quantity of inventory in replenishment at the start of a period) and the more common lead-time demand distribution, which are different when order crossover is possible. The lead-time demand distribution can have much higher variability than the shortfall distribution. We show that basing inventory policies on the lead-time demand distribution—rather than the shortfall distribution—can lead to significantly higher inventory cost, even if the probability of order crossover is small. We give an alternative proof to that of Zalkind (1976), which shows that the variance of shortfall is less than the variance of the standard lead-time demand.|Lawrence W. Robinson| James R.

A manufacturer distributes a durable product through an exclusive retailer to an exhaustible population of consumers with heterogeneous reservation prices. In each period, the manufacturer and retailer in turn set wholesale and retail prices, respectively, and customers with valuation above the retail price adopt the product at a constant (hazard) rate. We derive the open-loop, feedback, and myopic equilibria for this dynamic pricing game and compare it to the centralized solution. Although in an integrated supply chain a forward-looking dynamic pricing strategy is always desirable, we show that this is not the case in a decentralized setting, because of vertical competition. Our main result is that both supply chain entities are better off in the long run when they ignore the impact of current prices on future demand and focus on immediate-term profits. A numerical study confirms that this insight is robust under various supply- and demand-side effects. We use the channel efficiency corresponding to various pricing rules to further derive insights into decisions on decentralization and disintermediation.|Wei-yu Kevin Chiang||||||||||College of Business, City University of Hong Kong, Kowloon, Hong Kong||||||||||HONG KONG|||||||||

We examine the case where a firm introduces multiple generations of a durable product for which demand is characterized by a demand diffusion process. Under fixed introduction costs, we consider the case where available product technology improves stochastically. As such, delaying introduction to a later date may lead to the capture of further technology improvements, potentially at the cost of slowing sales for the existing product (and a decline in market potential for the product to be introduced, given our focus on durable products). We specify a state-based model of demand diffusion and construct a decision model to solve the firm’s introduction timing problem. By incorporating technology improvement in our model, we prove the optimality of a state-dependent threshold policy governing the firm’s product-introduction decisions. Numerical analysis reveals the influence of key model parameters on the pace of product introduction. Our model helps to explain the product-introduction behavior of firms and provides an alternative to previous explanations of IBM’s introduction timing decisions for successive generations of its mainframe computers.|R.

The hospital administrator decides on the number of wings to form, the number of beds to allocate to each wing, and the set of care types to assign to each wing to maximize the total utility to the hospital. The administrator faces an inherent trade-off between forming large wings to pool demand and bed capacity, and forming specialized wings to focus on narrow ranges of care types. Specialized wings not only provide advantages from focused care but also allow the protection of beds for high-utility care types. We provide an optimization model for the wing formation decision and address the advantages of focus endogenously in our model. Using data from a large urban teaching hospital in the United States along with a national database, we report on a number of managerial insights. In particular, as the overall demand increases across all care types, wings are formed to reserve more beds for higher-utility types, which leads to higher overall hospital utility but also some disparity across types, such as increased hospital access for some and decreased access for others. Furthermore, overall bed occupancy decreases as the hospital is split into wings. However, if sufficient focus is attained, shorter lengths-of-stay associated with focused care may increase overall patient throughput. We also observe that when patients are willing to wait longer for admission, the hospital tends to form more wings. This implies that hospitals that garner longer waits can form more specialized wings and thereby benefit from focused care, whereas hospitals that cannot will tend to form fewer, if any, wings, choosing to pool demand and bed capacity.|Thomas J.

Do newsvendors exhibit mean ordering simply because they make random errors? We subject this hypothesis to an empirical test that rests on the fact that the random error explanation is insensitive to context.

The first is the partitioning of server capacity among different customers based on their service time requirements. The second is rush hour demand where a large number of customers arrive over a short period of time followed by few or no arrivals for an extended period thereafter. We study a system with multiple parallel servers and multiple customer classes. The servers can be partitioned into server groups, each dedicated to a single customer class. The system operates under a rush hour regime with a large number of customers arriving at the beginning of the rush hour period. We show that this allows us to reduce the problem to one that is deterministic and for which closed-form solutions can be obtained. We compare the performance of the system with and without server partitioning during rush hour and address three basic questions. (1) Is partitioning beneficial to the system? (2) Is it equally beneficial to all customer classes? (3) If it is implemented, what is an optimal partition?

In practice, operations managers and human resource managers interact primarily on administrative issues regarding payroll and other matters. In academia, the two subjects are studied by separate communities of scholars publishing in disjoint sets of journals, drawing on mostly separate disciplinary foundations. Yet, operations and human resources are intimately related at a fundamental level. Operations are the context that often explains or moderates the effects of human resource activities such as pay, training, communications, and staffing. Human responses to OM systems often explain variations or anomalies that would otherwise be treated as randomness or error variance in traditional operations research models. In this paper, we probe the interface between operations and human resources by examining how human considerations affect classical OM results and how operational considerations affect classical HRM results. We then propose a unifying framework for identifying new research opportunities at the intersection of the two fields.|John Boudreau| Wallace Hopp| John O. McClain| L.

The manufacturer decides on the amount of its market expansion advertising investment in the first period and on its pricing strategy in both periods. Advertising increases the “size of the pie,” but eventually the manufacturer may end up inadvertently sharing the benefits with the copycat. After the first period, the copycat makes a market-entry decision, and, if it opts to enter, it also decides on a pricing strategy. The customers are strategic, and they decide whether or not to buy, when to buy, and which product to buy. We find that, interestingly, lower quality levels of the manufacturer’s product may increase the manufacturer’s prices and profit. Moreover, the manufacturer may be worseoff when customers are more likely to purchase its product immediately rather than wait for a price reduction or for the copycat’s product. Finally, the copycat may be worseoff when customers withhold their purchases in the first period in anticipation of the possibility of copycat product becoming available in a later period.|Hubert Pun| Gregory D.

Customers' perception of quality is determined by their likelihood of obtaining the product or service immediately upon request. We study the alternatives of offering either a subscription option that limits the number of concurrent rentals in return for a flat fee per-unit time, or a pay-per-use option with no such restriction. Customers are assumed to desire a nominal usage rate of the product, which they meet by adjusting their request rate in either option. Thus, they have a higher request rate in the subscription option. We propose a Markov chain model for customer behavior under the subscription option equivalent to the standard Poisson model under the pay-per-use option. In a large market setting, assuming exponential demand, we show that using the subscription option is more profitable for the firm. Further, via a numerical study, we show that this assumption is not essential for the result to hold. However, we show that the subscription option does not necessarily dominate the pay-per-use option in quality of service. The firm manages the trade-off between price and quality of service better in the subscription option. Moreover, we show that social welfare and the consumer surplus can also be higher in the subscription option, indicating that both the firm and the consumers can benefit from the subscription option.|Ramandeep S.

In particular, these inputs may be the customers themselves participating in the service delivery. Although many service firms have explored different ways of involving customers in their production process, there is no clear guideline for the design of such coproductive systems. In this paper, we develop an analytical model of joint production between a service provider and a customer and characterize how a service firm should design its coproductive system. We show that, as a task becomes more standard, it is desirable to decrease the degree of interaction between the provider and the customer by making their efforts more substitutable and to allocate most of the work to whoever is the most efficient. Conversely, as a task becomes less standard, it is optimal to increase interaction by making efforts more complementary and to balance the work allocation. Our analysis gives rise to a service-process framework with three archetypes of coproductive services: collaborative services, service factories, and self-services. We discuss the implications of our results for service process reengineering.|Guillaume Roels||||||||||UCLA Anderson School of Management, University of California, Los Angeles, Los Angeles, California 90095||||||||||USA|||||||||

In some settings (“vertical”) the coproducts differ along a performance dimension and are substitutable. In other settings (“horizontal”) the coproducts differ in their applications and are not substitutable. In both cases, three important attributes of a coproduct technology are its processing cost, overall yield, and coproduct split, i.e., the proportion of each output produced. For both vertical and horizontal settings with deterministic market sizes, we characterize the optimal pricing and production decisions of a monopoly firm with two technologies. We establish the necessary and sufficient conditions for dual activation (i.e., using both technologies) to be optimal. Dual activation is driven by differences in marginal costs across the two technologies. There is an additional motive for dual activation in the horizontal setting: the desire to generate a product mix that better resembles the market mix. Building on the optimal production analysis, we characterize the optimal adoption-and-usage strategy of a firm with one incumbent technology considering a new technology. We establish the conditions for which a new technology will displace the incumbent or be used with the incumbent, and highlight some important adoption and usage differences between vertical and horizontal settings.

While this problem context encompasses many possible applications, we focus primarily on multiple-response design problems that have been widely studied in the quality improvement and quality management literature. For such problems, several optimization criteria have been proposed, including maximization of process yield, maximization of process capability, minimization of process costs, etc. In this research, we propose a method that accounts for many of these criteria via a procedure that interacts with and relies on the preferences of a decision maker (DM). The interactive procedure evolves from the convergence of three areas of research: notably, the research in multiple-response design, the research in multicriteria optimization, and recent developments in global optimization. The proposed interactive method is illustrated and comparatively assessed via two well-known problems in multiple-response design. Although the interactive procedure is developed for application in multiple-response design, it is not limited to this problem context. The concepts and methods developed in this research have applicability to problems that can be characterized by process inputs and process performance, such as supply chain management and multidisciplinary design optimization.|Murat Köksalan| Robert D.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that global supply chains contributed to this diffusion, in the following sense. Firms in Europe were the first to seek ISO 9000 certification in large numbers. They then required their suppliers, including those abroad, to do likewise. Once the standard had thus entered other countries, it spread beyond those firms immediately exporting to Europe to be adopted by many other firms in those same countries. This paper empirically examines the validity of this view of the role of supply chains in global diffusion of ISO 9000. To do so, we decompose the statement “supply chains contributed to the global diffusion of ISO 9000” into a series of four requirements that must be met for the original statement to be supported. We then use firm-level data from a global survey of more than 5,000 firms in nine countries to test the hypotheses that correspond to these requirements. Our findings are consistent with the view that part of the global diffusion of ISO 9000 did move upstream in global supply chains. In short, this means that firms that export goods or services to a particular country may simultaneously be importing that country’s management practices. We conclude by suggesting how these findings might form the basis for future research on the environmental management systems standard ISO 14000.|Charles J.

The renewable technology can be coupled with conventional technologies to form a capacity portfolio that is used to meet stochastic demand for energy. The technologies have different initial investments and operating costs, and the operating costs follow different stochastic processes. We show how to reduce this problem to a single-period decision problem and how to estimate the joint distribution of the stochastic factors using historical data. Importantly, we show that data granularity for renewable yield and electricity demand at a fine level, such as hourly, matters: Without energy storage, coarse data that does not reflect the intermittency of renewable generation may lead to an overinvestment in renewable capacity. We obtain solutions that are simple to compute, intuitive, and provide managers with a framework for evaluating the trade-offs of investing in renewable and conventional technologies.

Although the firm has to invest in capital-intensive production facilities and produce outputs in the face of demand and exchange rate uncertainties, it can postpone the transshipment, localization, and distribution of the output until after uncertainties are resolved. The key network design decisions faced by the firm are in which of the two markets to locate the capital-intensive production facilities and what the corresponding output levels should be. We provide the complete characterization of the optimal global facility network configuration for two types of global firms: a newsvendor with exogenously given selling prices and a firm with the flexibility of pricing responsively after uncertainties are resolved. Our study's focus is on the impact of exchange rate uncertainty and responsive pricing on facility network decisions. Compared with a newsvendor facing demand uncertainty only, the introduction of exchange rate uncertainty or the use of responsive pricing can increase the attractiveness of centralized production. A responsive-pricing firm's optimal network design differs from that of a newsvendor firm as follows. (1) The firm's network preference is less susceptible to the increase of localization costs. (2) The firm is less likely to switch from a network of regional production to a network of centralized production in response to the increasing size of one market. (3) Demand and exchange rate uncertainties can have opposite effects on its optimal centralized output when the nature of the random shocks they introduce to the firm's demand function is different: under the linear demand function, the optimal centralized output increases in the demand volatility when demand shock is additive, but it may decrease in the exchange rate volatility because the corresponding price shock is multiplicative. Interestingly, common to both types of firms, their network preferences, although sensitive to costs and mean demand and exchange rate, are robust to the demand and exchange rate volatilities, suggesting that transshipment-enabled output substitutability between the two markets diminishes the impact of increasing market volatilities on the network design decision.|Lingxiu Dong| Panos Kouvelis| Ping Su||||||||Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130|Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130|School of Business, State University of New York at New Paltz, New Paltz, New York 12561||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

In a typical call center equipped with an IVR system, customers are handled first by the IVR system, which is a computerized system that often enables customers to self-serve. Those customers whose service cannot be handled by the IVR system are sent to the second stage to be served by agents. To address the design of a call center with a flexible IVR system, we consider a call center whose IVR system can operate in two different service delivery modes that have statistically different outcomes. We formulate a stochastic program to determine the number of agents needed in the second stage as well as the proportion of customers that should be selected for each IVR service mode under different demand levels with the objective of minimizing the total staffing and abandonment costs. We also propose dynamic control policies to achieve the optimal proportions without the knowledge of the exact arrival rate. We show that the staffing levels found by the stochastic program combined with the proposed routing policies are asymptotically optimal in large systems.

From 2006 to 2009, the car business undertook 2,121 quality improvement initiatives at these suppliers, while the commercial vehicles business did not undertake any such initiatives. We find that the quality knowledge developed through the quality improvement initiatives undertaken by the car business does not easily spill over to benefit the commercial vehicles business. Quality knowledge spills over under three conditions: (1) when quality improvement efforts are focused on organizational members, as opposed to when they focus on routines or technology; (2) when quality improvement efforts focus on the output activities of suppliers, not when they focus on the input or in-process activities; and (3) when quality knowledge is developed at suppliers with low complexity in their operations.

A manufacturer can sell either early, i.e., well in advance of the selling season, or late, i.e., close to the selling season. This paper examines the impact of information asymmetry, retailer sales effort, and contract type on the manufacturer’s sale-timing decision. We find that if information is symmetric, demand is not influenced by sales effort, and the contract specifies that the price paid is linear in the order quantity, the manufacturer prefers to sell late. This result extends to the case where the retailer exerts sales effort during the selling season. However, if the retailer exerts sales effort prior to the selling season or has superior information about market demand, the manufacturer may prefer to sell early. We characterize the manufacturer’s sale-timing preference in these settings, providing clear conditions under which the manufacturer prefers to sell either early or late. We show that the retailer, manufacturer, and total system may be hurt by the retailer’s having higher-quality information.|Terry A.

It implements a perpetual flow cycle, where funds convert to product and back to funds. The system is stationary, and revenues and costs flow directly to the parent company. The parent company aims to maximize equilibrium (long-run) financial metrics in terms of net profit rate and rate of return. To this end, we model this system as a discrete-state continuous-time Markov process and compute its equilibrium state distribution using analytic and numerical methods. These are then used to derive statistics of the equilibrium cash conversion cycle and define equilibrium financial rate metrics and cumulative counterparts that incorporate the time value of money.

For a two-party supply chain, comprising a manufacturer and a supplier that both invest in capacity, we prove the existence of a class of coordinating price-only contracts that arbitrarily allocate the supply chain profit. Moreover, if the supplier's reservation profit is below a certain threshold, the manufacturer's optimal contract is a quantity-premium price-only schedule, that is, the average wholesale price per unit increases in the order size. We prove that the manufacturer prefers simple piecewise-linear quantity-premium contracts to linear contracts and show numerically that such contracts are highly efficient. We extend our results for piecewise-linear price schedules to N-supplier assembly systems. We also enrich the voluntary compliance regime of Cachon and Lariviere (2001). With this enrichment, we prove that share-the-pain contracts, such as firm commitment and options contracts, increase supplier capacity in the full information case, a result that contrasts with that of Cachon and Lariviere. Finally, we investigate when a manufacturer prefers single-breakpoint quantity premiums to firm commitments.|Brian Tomlin||||||||||Kenan-Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599-3490||||||||||USA|||||||||

In this research we develop a stylized model to analyze the impact of using time guarantees on competition. Demands are assumed to be sensitive to both the price and delivery time guarantees, and the objective of each firm is to select the best price and time guarantee to maximize its operating profit. We first analyze the optimization problem for the individual firms and then study the equilibrium solution in a multiple-firm competition. Using a numerical study, we further illustrate how the different firm and market characteristics would affect the price and delivery time competition in the market. Our results suggest that the equilibrium price and time guarantee decisions in an oligopolistic market with identical firms behave in a similar fashion as the optimal solution in a monopolistic situation from a previous study. However, when there are heterogeneous firms in the market, these firms will exploit their distinctive firm characteristics to differentiate their services. Assuming all other factors being equal, the high capacity firms provide better time guarantees, while firms with lower operating costs offer lower prices, and the differentiation becomes more acute as demands become more time-sensitive. Furthermore, as time-attractiveness of the market increases, firms compete less on price, and the equilibrium prices of the firms increase as a result. Our findings provide important implications about firm behaviour under price and time competition.|Kut C.

Before the demand is realized, each retailer independently orders her initial inventory. After the demand is realized, the retailers select an optimal transshipment pattern and ship residual inventories to meet residual demands. Unsold inventories are salvaged at the end of the period. We compare two methods for distribution of residual profit—transshipment prices (TPs) and dual allocations (DAs)—that were previously analyzed in literature. TPs are selected before the demand is known, and DAs, which are obtained by calculating the dual prices for the transshipment problem, are calculated after observing the true demand. We first study the conditions for the existence of the Nash equilibria under DA and then compare the performance of the two methods and show that neither allocation method dominates the other. Our analysis suggests that DAs may yield higher efficiency among “more asymmetric” retailers, whereas TPs work better with retailers that are “more alike,” but the difference in profits does not seem significant. We also link expected dual prices to TPs and use those results to develop heuristics for TPs with more than two symmetric retailers. For general instances with more than two asymmetric retailers, we propose a TP agreement that uses a neutral central depot to coordinate the transshipments (TPND). Although DAs in general outperform TPND in our numerical simulations, its ease of implementation makes TPND an attractive alternative to DAs when the efficiency losses are not significant (e.g., high critical fractiles or lower demand variances).|Xiao Huang| Greys Sošić|||||||||Desautels Faculty of Management, McGill University, Montr茅al, Qu茅bec H3A 1G5, Canada|Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089|||||||||CANADA|USA||||||||

This article reports a retailer's challenge to balance transportation, shelf space, and inventory costs. A retailer sells multiple products with stochastic demand. Trucks are dispatched from a warehouse and arrive at a store with a constant lead time. Each truck has a finite capacity and incurs a fixed shipping cost, no matter the number of units shipped. There is a per unit shelf-space cost as well as holding and backorder penalty costs. Three policies are considered for dispatching trucks: a minimum quantity continuous review policy, a full service periodic review policy, and a minimum quantity periodic review policy. The first policy ships a truck when demand since the previous shipment equals a fixed fraction of a truck's capacity, i.e., a minimum truck utilization. The exact analysis of that policy is the same as the analysis of reorder point policies for the multiechelon problem with one-warehouse, multiple retailers, and stochastic demand. That analysis is not computationally prohibitive, but the minimum quantity level can be chosen with a simple economic order quantity (EOQ) heuristic. An extensive numerical study finds the following: Either of the two periodic review policies may have substantially higher costs than the continuous review policy, in particular when the warehouse to store lead time is short; the EOQ heuristic performs quite well; the minimum quantity policy's total cost is relatively insensitive to the chosen transportation utilization, and its total cost is close to a lower bound developed for this problem.|Gerard Cachon||||||||||1300 SH/DH, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104||||||||||USA|||||||||

Under the observed market conditions, mix flexibility accounts for substantial average savings by reducing price discounting by approximately 10% of the average industry discount. We test three supplementary hypotheses and find that the reduction in discounts for vehicles manufactured at flexible plants is (1) higher for higher demand uncertainty, (2) higher for vehicles coproduced with vehicles that belong to a different segment, and (3) lower in situations with higher local competition.|Antonio Moreno| Christian Terwiesch|||||||||Managerial Economics and Decision Sciences, Kellogg School of Management, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208|Operations and Information Management Department, The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

Recognizing that such behavior may not be directly observable by a seller, we examine the implications of seller uncertainty over strategic customer behavior in a markdown pricing setting. We assume that some proportion of customers purchase impulsively in the first period if the price is below their willingness to pay, while other customers strategically wait for lower prices in the second period. We consider a two-period selling season in which the seller knows the aggregate demand curve but not the proportion of customers behaving strategically. We show that a robust pricing policy that requires no knowledge of the extent of strategic behavior performs remarkably well. We extend our model to a setting with stochastic demand, and show that the robust pricing policy continues to perform well, particularly as capacity is loosened or the problem is scaled up. Our results underscore the need to recognize strategic behavior, but also suggest that in many cases effective performance is possible without precise knowledge of strategic behavior.|Adam J.

We consider this question for a queueing system with two customer types and provide the following results. First, we develop a novel problem formulation and solution method that combines the achievable region approach with mechanism design. This approach extends to menu design problems for other systems. Second, the work conserving cμ priority rule, known to be delay cost minimizing, incentive-compatible, and socially optimal, need not be revenue maximizing. A strategic delay policy may be optimal: It prioritizes impatient customers, but artificially inflates the lead times of patient customers. This suggests a broader guideline: Revenue-maximizing firms that lack customer-level demand information should also consider customer incentives, not only operational constraints, in their scheduling policies. Third, we identify general necessary and sufficient conditions for optimal strategic delay: a price, a lead-time, and a segment-size condition. We translate these into demand and capacity parameter conditions for cases with homogeneous and heterogeneous valuations for each type. In some cases strategic delay is optimal if capacity is relatively abundant, in others if it is relatively scarce.|Philipp Afèche||||||||||Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3E6, Canada||||||||||CANADA|||||||||

The implication is that any operational system that has minimized inefficiencies is also more environmentally sustainable. However, in this paper we argue that the underlying mechanism is one of extending the horizons of analysis and that this applies to both theory and practice of operations management. We illustrate this through two principal areas of lean operations, where we identify how successive extensions of the prevailing research horizon in each area have led to major advances in theory and practice. First, in quality management, the initial emphasis on statistical quality control of individual operations was extended through total quality management to include a broader process encompassing customer requirements and suppliers’ operations. More recently, the environmental perspective extended the definition of customers to stakeholders and defects to any form of waste. Second, in supply chain management, the horizon first expanded from the initial focus on optimizing inventory control with a single planner to including multiple organizations with conflicting objectives and private information. The environmental perspective draws attention to aspects such as reverse flows and end-of-life product disposal, again potentially improving the performance of the overall supply chain. In both cases, these developments were initially driven by practice, where many of the benefits of adopting an environmental perspective were unexpected. Given that these unexpected side benefits seem to recur so frequently, we refer to this phenomenon as the “law of the expected unexpected side benefits.” We conclude by extrapolating from the developmental paths of total quality management and supply chain management to speculate about the future of environmental research in operations management.|Charles J.

Following common industry practice, we assume knowledge of a deterministic demand function that is nonincreasing in price. We consider three alternative measures of scheduling cost: total work-in-process inventory cost of orders, total penalty for orders delivered late to customers, and total capacity usage. The objective is to maximize the total net profit, i.e., revenue less scheduling cost, resulting from the pricing and scheduling decisions. We develop computationally efficient optimal algorithms for solving the three pricing and scheduling problems. Because these problems are formally intractable, much faster algorithms are not possible. We develop a fully polynomial time approximation scheme for each problem. We also estimate the value of coordinating pricing and production scheduling decisions by comparing solutions delivered by (a) an uncoordinated approach where pricing and scheduling decisions are made independently, (b) a partially coordinated approach that uses only general information about scheduling that a marketing department typically knows, (c) a simple heuristic approach for solving the coordinated problem, and (d) our optimal algorithm for solving the coordinated problem. Our main managerial insight is that there is a significant benefit even if pricing and scheduling are only heuristically or partially coordinated. Moreover, heuristic and partial coordination are simple to achieve.|Zhi-Long Chen| Nicholas G. Hall|||||||||Robert H.

We prove that our formulation is convex, and the optimal amount of capacity reserved for emergency jobs in each period decreases with the number of elective jobs waiting for service. However, the optimal policy is difficult to compute exactly. We develop the idea of a limit policy starting at a particular time, and use this policy to obtain upper and lower bounds on the decisions of an optimal policy in each period, and also to develop several computationally efficient policies.

We tackle these questions by characterizing control and staffing schemes that are asymptotically optimal in the limit, as the system load grows large. Our main finding is that a threshold priority control, in which cross-selling is exercised only if the number of callers in the system is below a certain threshold, is asymptotically optimal in great generality. The asymptotic optimality of threshold priority reduces the staffing problem to a solution of a simple deterministic problem in one regime and to a simple search procedure in another.

In the transportation domain, car-sharing models are being adopted on a mass scale in major metropolitan areas worldwide. This mode of servicized mobility bridges the resource efficiency of public transit and the flexibility of personal transportation. Beyond the significant potential to reduce car ownership, car sharing shows promise in supporting the adoption of fuel-efficient vehicles, such as electric vehicles (EVs), because of these vehicles’ special cost structure with high purchase but low operating costs. Recently, key players in the car-sharing business, such as Autolib’, car2go, and DriveNow, have begun to employ EVs in an operations model that accommodates one-way trips. On the one hand (and particularly in free-floating car sharing), the one-way model results in significant improvements in coverage of travel needs and therefore in adoption potential compared with the conventional round-trip-only model (advocated by Zipcar, for example). On the other hand, this model poses tremendous planning and operational challenges. In this work, we study the planning problem faced by service providers in designing a geographical service region in which to operate the service. This decision entails trade-offs between maximizing customer catchment by covering travel needs and controlling fleet operation costs. We develop a mathematical programming model that incorporates details of both customer adoption behavior and fleet management (including EV repositioning and charging) under imbalanced travel patterns. To address inherent planning uncertainty with regard to adoption patterns, we employ a distributionally robust optimization framework that informs robust decisions to overcome possible ambiguity (or lacking) of data. Mathematically, the problem can be approximated by a mixed integer second-order cone program, which is computationally tractable with practical scale data. Applying this approach to the case of car2go’s service with real operations data, we address a number of planning questions and suggest that there is potential for the future development of this service.|Long He| Ho-Yin Mak| Ying Rong| Zuo-Jun Max Shen|||||||NUS Business School, National University of Singapore, Singapore 119245|Sa茂d Business School, University of Oxford, Oxford OX1 1HP, United Kingdom|Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China 200030|Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research and Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, University of California, Berkeley, Berkeley, California 94720|||||||SINGAPORE|UNITED KINGDOM|CHINA|USA||||||

Such an analysis allows price competition to be modeled without a priori assumptions about price-setting power or pricing procedures. The paper shows that with no uncertainty, the inventory decision is equivalent to the capacity decision in Cournot competition. With uncertainty, the analysis again reduces to Cournot competition if the demand uncertainty is characterized by an appropriately constructed, expected demand curve.

We investigate the savings due to better coordination of production and delivery facilitated by such an agreement. The optimal behavior of both the supplier and the retailer are characterized. The optimal replenishment and production policies for a supplier are found to be up-to policies, which are shown to be easily computed by decoupling the periods when the supplier outsources from those when the supplier does not outsource. A simple application of the newsvendor relation is used to define the retailer's optimal policy. Numerical analysis is conducted to compare the performance of a single supplier and a single retailer operating under a (z, Z) VMI contract with the performance of those operating under traditional retailer-managed inventory (RMI) with information sharing. Our results verify some observations made in industry about VMI and show that the (z, Z) type of VMI agreement performs significantly better than RMI in many settings, but can perform worse in others.|Michael J.

In New York City, this corresponds to 400 patients. There are currently 140 burn beds in the region, which can be surged up to 210. To care for additional patients, hospitals without burn centers will be used to stabilize patients until burn beds become available. In this work, we develop a new system for prioritizing patients for transfer to burn beds as they become available and demonstrate its superiority over several other triage methods. Based on data from previous burn catastrophes, we study the feasibility of being able to admit 400 patients to burn beds within the critical three- to five-day time frame. We find that this is unlikely and that the ability to do so is highly dependent on the type of event and the demographics of the patient population.

We consider a class of appointment planning problems that involve two sets of decisions: job sequencing, i.e., determining the order in which a list of jobs should be performed by the server, and appointment scheduling, i.e., planning the starting times for jobs. These decisions are interconnected because their joint goal is to minimize the expected server idle time and job late-start penalty costs incurred because of randomness in job durations. In this paper, we design new heuristics for sequencing appointments. The idea behind the development of these heuristics is the structural connection between such appointment scheduling problems and stochastic inventory control in serial supply chains. In particular, the decision of determining time allowances as buffers against random job durations is analogous to that of selecting inventory levels as buffers to accommodate random demand in a supply chain; having excess buffers in appointment scheduling and supply chain settings incurs idle time and excess inventory holding costs, respectively, and having inadequate buffers leads to delays of subsequent jobs and backorders, respectively. Recognizing this connection, we propose tractable approximations for the job sequencing problem, obtain several insights, and further develop a very simple sequencing rule of ordering jobs by duration variance to late-start penalty cost ratio. Computational results show that our proposed heuristics produce close-to-optimal job sequences with significantly reduced computation times compared with those produced using an exact mixed-integer stochastic programming formulation based on the sample-average approximation approach.|Ho-Yin Mak| Ying Rong| Jiawei Zhang||||||||Department of Industrial Engineering and Logistics Management, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Kowloon, Hong Kong|Antai College of Economics and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 200052 Shanghai, China|Department of Information, Operations, and Management Sciences, Stern School of Business, New York University, New York 10012, New York||||||||HONG KONG|CHINA|USA|||||||

However, surprisingly little research examines the relationship between such inspections and future product quality. In this paper, we study how well plant inspection outcomes predict the hazard of a future recall and analyze how investigator experience affects this predictive relationship. Using secondary data spanning a seven-year period in the medical device industry and a recurrent-event Cox proportional hazard model, our analysis shows that inspection outcomes reliably predict future product recalls. However, inspection outcomes become an unreliable predictor of recalls with an increase in site-specific investigator experience. Through post hoc analysis, we also show that the hazard of a recall at a plant increases with site-specific experience, independent of the inspection outcome. Compared to the first visit by an investigator, the recall hazard increases by 21% the second time the investigator visits a specific plant, and by 57% on the third visit. We propose investigator rotation and investigator sequencing as two policies to help mitigate this increased recall risk.|George Ball | Enno Siemsen | Rachna Shah ||||||||Operations and Decision Technologies Department, Kelley School of Business, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana 47405|Operations and Information Management Department, Wisconsin School of Business, University of Wisconsin鈥揗adison, Madison, Wisconsin 53706|Supply Chain and Operations Department, Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

We extend a cost-based location-inventory model (Shen et al. 2003) to include a customer service element and develop practical methods for quick and meaningful evaluation of cost/service trade-offs. Service is measured by the fraction of all demands that are located within an exogenously specified distance of the assigned distribution center. The nonlinear model simultaneously determines distribution center locations and the assignment of demand nodes to distribution centers to optimize the cost and service objectives. We use a weighting method to find all supported points on the trade-off curve. We also propose a heuristic solution approach based on genetic algorithms that can generate optimal or close-to-optimal solutions in a much shorter time compared to the weighting method.

In this paper, we consider a supplier-retailer supply chain in which the supplier starts production well in advance of the selling season, and the retailer is offered two ordering opportunities at different points in time. An early order is allowed before the supplier’s production decision, and a late order is allowed after the completion of production and after observing the demand. When the two wholesale prices change, we illustrate how the inventory decision rights and ownership are shifted and/or shared between the two firms, resulting in push, pull, or advance-purchase discount contracts. We then characterize the complete set of Pareto-dominant contracts for any given two-wholesale-price contract. We find that Pareto improvement can be achieved when inventory ownership is shifted from individual to shared and sometimes vice versa. In the latter case, push contracts not only are more likely to offer Pareto improvement, but also can achieve higher supply chain efficiency than pull contracts. We also identify conditions that enable Pareto improvement by introducing a new ordering opportunity to firms that had been bound by a single ordering opportunity without renegotiating the existing wholesale price, and we demonstrate through a numerical study that the adoption of the new ordering opportunity can significantly improve supply chain efficiency. We show that such Pareto improvement is more likely to happen when demand is more volatile.|Lingxiu Dong| Kaijie Zhu|||||||||John M.

One potential procurement mechanism for such a buyer is to bundle the procurement project with technology acquisition. We propose a dynamic stochastic game-theoretic model that analyzes the optimal technology offer strategies of the asymmetric suppliers and highlights how the size of the current project, relative to the size of the future market, and supplier competition determine the effectiveness of the bundled procurement mechanism for the buyer. For the two-supplier case, we find that each supplier has a dominant technology offer strategy that is independent of the opponent’s strategy. When the relative size of the project is small, suppliers only offer obsolete technologies even if their technologies are perfect substitutes. While suppliers offer better technologies as the project size increases, their responses in technology offers are not continuous with respect to the project size—once the project size reaches some threshold, suppliers’ optimal responses jump to their best technologies. We also observe that the premium needed for technology acquisition under the bundled procurement mechanism can be negligible compared to the expected profit from the future market.|Leon Yang Chu| Yunzeng Wang|||||||||Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089|Anderson Graduate School of Management, University of California, Riverside, Riverside, California 92521|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

We develop a model of premium room and standby upgrade pricing under an uncertain market size and examine how and when standby upgrades can provide additional revenue for a hotel. When guests are myopic, we show that standby upgrades can be used as a powerful price discrimination tool, especially for hotel properties with high premium-to-standard room ratios. When guests are strategic, the benefit of standby upgrades is significantly diminished; we show that standby upgrades only increase revenue when the hotel property has a low premium-to-standard room ratio.

However, the stringency of emissions regulation varies across regions, raising concerns over carbon leakage—an outcome where stringent regulation in one region shifts production to regions with weaker regulation. It is believed that such leakage adversely increases global emissions. It is also believed that leakage can be eliminated by carbon tariffs, which are taxes imposed on imported goods so that they incur the same emissions cost that they would have if they had been produced in the regulated region. Results here contradict these beliefs. This paper demonstrates that carbon leakage can arise despite a carbon tariff but, when it does arise under a carbon tariff, it decreases emissions. Due in part to this clean leakage, results here indicate that a carbon tariff decreases global emissions. Domestic firm profits, on the other hand, can increase, decrease, or remain unchanged due to a carbon tariff, which suggests that carbon tariffs are not inherently protectionist as some argue. Rather, results here suggest that carbon tariffs improve the efficacy of emissions regulation, enabling it to reduce global emissions in many settings in which it would otherwise fail to do so.|David F.

At the time of contracting, the outsourcing firm, “the originator,” faces uncertainty regarding the demand volume but has private information about its probability distribution. The true demand is quickly observed once the service commences. The service provider invests in capacity before the start of the operation and offers a menu of contracts to screen different types of the originator. Adopting a mechanism design approach, we prove that a menu of two-part tariffs achieves the full-information solution.

From an implementation perspective, it is desirable to design a simple policy like a base-stock list-price (BSLP) policy. The existing research on this problem often imposes restrictive conditions to ensure the optimality of a BSLP policy, which limits its applicability in practice. In this paper, we analyze the dynamic inventory and pricing control problem in which the demand follows a generalized additive model (GAM). The GAM overcomes the limitations of several demand models commonly used in the literature, but introduces analytical challenges in analyzing the dynamic program. Via a variable transformation approach, we identify a new set of technical conditions under which a BSLP policy is optimal. These conditions are easy to verify because they depend only on the location and scale parameters of demand as functions of price and are independent of the cost parameters or the distribution of the random demand component. Moreover, although a BSLP policy is optimal under these conditions, the optimal price may not be monotone decreasing in the inventory level. We further demonstrate our results by applying a constrained maximum likelihood estimation procedure to simultaneously estimate the demand function and verify the optimality of a BSLP policy on a retail data set.|Qi Feng| Sirong Luo| Dan Zhang||||||||Krannert School of Management, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907|School of Statistics and Management, Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, Shanghai 200433, China; and Key Laboratory of Mathematical Economics (SUFE), Ministry of Education, Shanghai 200433, China|Leads School of Business, University of Colorado at Boulder, Boulder, Colorado 80309||||||||USA|CHINA|USA|||||||

The retailers replenish their stock from the warehouse, which in turn places orders at an outside supplier with infinite capacity. Transportation times and costs are constant. No ordering costs are considered, but warehouse replenishments must be multiples of a given batch quantity. The objective is to find policies that minimize holding and backorder costs. The standard approach to approximately solve this problem is to use a “balance” assumption, meaning that negative stock allocations to the retailers are possible. This approach may lead to considerable errors for problems with large differences between the retailers in terms of service requirements and demand characteristics. To handle such situations we suggest and evaluate two computationally tractable heuristics: the Virtual Assignment ordering rule for warehouse replenishments and the Two-step Allocation rule for allocating stock from the warehouse to the retailers. Numerical evidence shows that, especially when combining these heuristics, we obtain considerable improvements for many problems over the standard approach.

In fact, CTO has made irrelevant the notion of preconfigured machine types and focuses instead on maintaining the right amount of inventory at the components. CTO appears to be the ideal operational model that provides both mass customization and a quick response time to order fulfillment. To quantify the inventory-service trade-off in the CTO environment, we develop a nonlinear optimization model with multiple constraints, reflecting the service levels offered to different market segments. To solve the optimization problem, we develop an exact algorithm for the important case of demand in each market segment having (at least) one unique component, and a greedy heuristic for the general (nonunique component) case. Furthermore, we show how to use sensitivity analysis, along with simulation, to fine-tune the solutions. The performance of the model and the solution approach is examined by extensive numerical studies on realistic problem data. We present the major findings in applying our model to study the inventory-service impacts in the reengineering of a PC manufacturing process.|Feng Cheng| Markus Ettl| Grace Lin| David D.

Even large suppliers (e.g., Delphi) could file for bankruptcy, and manufacturers' actions, such as financial subsidies to suppliers, profoundly affect suppliers' financial health. Using a dynamic, stochastic, periodic-review model of the manufacturer's joint capacity reservation and financial subsidy decisions and a general firm-value model of the supplier's financial state, this paper addresses the following questions: What is the optimal joint capacity ordering and financial subsidy policy for the manufacturer? Must subsidy and capacity ordering decisions be made jointly? How good are the recommendations from the traditional procurement models, which ignore the benefits of controlling the supplier's financial state through subsidies? The paper presents general assumptions that allow the manufacturer to make ordering decisions independent of subsidy decisions and investigates interactions between ordering and subsidy decisions when these assumptions are violated. Conditions are presented for the optimal subsidy policy to have a “subsidize-up-to” structure and for the optimal ordering decisions to be newsvendor fractiles.|Volodymyr Babich||||||||||McDonough School of Business, Georgetown University, Washington, DC 20057||||||||||USA|||||||||

It is like a series inventory system, but stock can be held at any point along a continuum, not just at discrete stages. We assume stationary parameters and aim to minimize the long-run average total cost. We show that a stationary continuous-stage echelon base-stock policy is optimal. That is, at each geographic point along the supply stream, there is a target echelon inventory level, and the optimal policy at all times is to order and dispatch material so as to move the echelon inventory position as close as possible to this target. We establish this result by showing that the solutions to certain discrete-stage systems converge monotonically to a limit, as the distances between the stages become small, and this limit solves the continuous-stage system. With demand approximated by a Brownian motion, we show that, in the continuous-stage limit, the supply stream model is equivalent to one describing first-passage times. This linkage leads to some interesting and useful results. Specifically, we obtain a partial differential equation that characterizes the optimal cost function, and we find a closed-form expression for the optimal echelon base-stock levels in a certain special case, the first in the inventory literature. These expressions demonstrate that the well-known square-root law for safety stock does not apply in this context.|Jing-Sheng Song| Paul Zipkin|||||||||Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708|Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

We then show that OSD also affects how salient costs such as customs duties and shipping costs influence offshoring–reshoring profit comparisons.

At the time that the goods arrive at the warehouses, demand realizations are known by the retailers. The retailers can increase their expected joint profits if they can coordinate their orders and make allocations after demand realization. For this setting, we consider an associated cooperative game between the retailers. We show that this associated cooperative game has a nonempty core.

The rate to harvest crops and the corresponding capital investment are critical strategic decisions in situations where poor weather conditions present a risk of crop loss. In this article, we discuss a case study of the Concord grape harvest and develop a mathematical model to control harvest risk. The model involves differentiation of a joint probability distribution that represents risks associated with the length of the harvest season and the size of the crop. This approach is becoming popular as a means of dealing with complex problems involving operational and supply chain risk. Significant cost avoidance, in the millions of dollars, results from practical implementation of the Harvest Model. Using real data, we found that the Harvest Model provides lower-cost solutions in situations involving moderate variability in both the length of season and the crop size as compared to solutions based on imposed risk policies determined by management.|Stuart J.

The extensive literature has offered the following explanations for why posterior price matching is adopted: to reduce inventory, to soften competition, to price discriminate consumers, and to eliminate consumer strategic waiting incentives. In this paper, we provide a novel explanation and investigate the role of consumer bounded rationality in the sense of anecdotal reasoning. We adopt a simple model that allows us to isolate the role of customer bounded rationality on using posterior price matching. We demonstrate that while it is never optimal to adopt posterior price matching when consumers have rational expectations, it can be optimal when they have boundedly rational expectations. We show when and how a seller can intentionally mark down with some probability and adopt price matching to make a profit. Ignoring customer bounded rationality can result in a significant profit loss. Then, we build a dynamic programming model to investigate how the firm should dynamically manage its markdowns over the long run. We show that a cyclic policy switching between a high and low markdown probability is typically optimal for exploiting customer bounded rationality. We characterize the nature of the cyclic policy and the range in which it is optimal. Our findings underscore the importance of consumer bounded rationality and provide managerial and practical guidelines on how to manage price matching when customers are boundedly rational.|Tingliang Huang| Zhe Yin| Ying-Ju Chen||||||||Carroll School of Management, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts 02467|School of Management, Shanghai University, Shanghai 200444, China|School of Business and Management and School of Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong||||||||USA|CHINA|HONG KONG|||||||

The bulk of this literature is of a theoretical nature, for example, analytical models, programming models, or conjectures based on casual observations of practice. Some of this literature purports, especially in introductions to the topic, that cost generally decreases with increasing commonality. However, based on a review of the theoretical literature using an activity-based costing framework and distinguishing between cost-driver and cost-rate effects, I conclude that the cost picture is more subtle. In other words, it is too early to make any general statement about the effect of increasing commonality on total costs. Moving to the limited empirical literature on the topic, consisting of case studies (sometimes combined with simulation) and empirical research on larger data sets, the conclusion that there is even more room for future research becomes evident.|Eva Labro||||||||||Department of Accounting and Finance, London School of Economics, Houghton Street, London WC2A 2AE, United Kingdom||||||||||UNITED KINGDOM|||||||||

Such models provide a parsimonious framework to study various problems of stochastic capacity investment and inventory management, including assembly, commonality, distribution, flexibility, substitution and transshipment. Newsvendor networks are stochastic models with recourse that are characterized by linear revenue and cost structures and a linear input-output transformation. While capacity and inventory decisions are locked in before uncertainty is resolved, some managerial discretion remains via ex-post input-output activity decisions. Ex-post decisions involve both the choice of activities and their levels and can result in subtle benefits. This discretion in choice is captured through alternate or “nonbasic” activities that can redeploy inputs and resources to best respond to resolved uncertain events. Nonbasic activities are never used in a deterministic environment; their value stems from discretionary flexibility to meet stochastic demand deviations from the operating point.|Jan A.

The firm may deliberately understock products in the markdown period to induce high-value customers to purchase early at full price. Customers cannot perfectly anticipate availability. Instead, they use observed past capacities to form capacity expectations according to a heuristic smoothing rule. Based on their expectations of capacity, customers decide to buy either in the full-price period or in the markdown period. We embed this customer learning process in a dynamic program of the firm's capacity choices over time. One main result demonstrates the existence of a monotone optimal path of customers' expectations, which converges to either a rationing equilibrium or a low-price-only equilibrium. Further, there exists a critical value of capacity expectation such that the market converges to a rationing equilibrium if customers' initial expectations are less than that critical value; otherwise, a low-price-only equilibrium is the limiting outcome. These results show how firms can be stuck with unprofitable selling strategies from incumbent customer expectations. We also examine numerically how this critical value is affected by the firm's discount factor and customers' learning speed and risk aversion. Last, we show that the equilibrium under adaptive learning converges to that under rational expectations as the firm's discount factor approaches one.|Qian Liu| Garrett van Ryzin|||||||||Industrial Engineering and Logistics Management Department, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong|Graduate School of Business, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027|||||||||HONG KONG|USA||||||||

In our model, a firm contracts with a risk-neutral sales agent with limited liability whose effort increases the demand stochastically. The firm designs the incentive contract and invests in inventory; the agent decides the sales effort. We find that the sales-quota-based bonus contract is optimal in such an environment, and the quota should be set equal to the inventory level when the first-best solution is not attainable. We further reveal that demand censorship can introduce peculiar effects on the optimal sales effort and service level that the firm implements. From our analysis of the additive and multiplicative effort cases, we find that in the additive effort case, it can be optimal, under demand censorship, for the firm to induce an effort and maintain a service level both greater than those under the first-best solution. Scenarios also exist where the firm should induce zero effort. For the multiplicative effort case, the optimal sales effort under demand censorship is lower than the first-best effort, whereas the optimal service level is higher than the first-best service level. The agent earns zero rent in the additive effort case but may earn a positive rent in the multiplicative effort case. Finally, our numerical analysis shows that demand censorship can have a significant negative impact on the value of contracting with the sales agent, especially when the sales margin is low and the market uncertainty is high.|Leon Yang Chu| Guoming Lai|||||||||Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089|McCombs School of Business, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

Doing so often requires significant time and monetary investments. To understand the trade-offs involved in deciding when to hire the first employee and how hiring differs in entrepreneurial settings from more established firm settings, we present a simple growth model that depends on two critical inputs for revenue generation: the entrepreneur’s time and money. We show that without hiring, the entrepreneur’s time eventually becomes more valuable than money in contributing to the firm’s growth. In that context, the value of the employee is driven by how much relief he provides to the entrepreneur. We characterize the optimal timing of hiring in terms of the firm’s cash position and how the firm is affected if it requires an upfront fixed investment in time and/or money. We find that the upfront investment in time needed for hiring cannot be converted to an equivalent upfront investment in money and that mistiming hiring can be very costly, especially when these upfront investments are high.|Onesun Steve Yoo| Guillaume Roels| Charles J.

It stipulates a maximum percentage revision each element of the period-by-period replenishment schedule is allowed per planning iteration. The supplier is obligated to cover any requests that remain within the upside limits. The bounds on reductions are a form of minimum purchase commitment which discourages the customer from overstating its needs. While QF contracts are being implemented in industrial practice, the academic literature has thus far had little guidance to offer a firm interested in structuring its supply relationships in this way. This paper seeks to address this need, by developing rigorous conclusions about the behavioral consequences of QF contracts, and hence about the implications for the performance and design of supply chains with linkages possessing this structure. Issues explored include the impact of system flexibility on inventory characteristics and the patterns by which forecast and order variability propagate along the supply chain. The ultimate goal is to provide insights as to where to position flexibility for the greatest benefit, and how much to pay for it.|A. A. Tsay| W. S.

The pricing of their capacity is an important problem in practice for pipeline companies and the users of this capacity, which include shippers such as natural gas merchants, producers, and local distribution companies. This paper conducts a normative analysis of how pipeline capacity should be priced by each of these players. Although the trading value of this capacity should be relevant to merchants and its substitution and congestion values to shippers and pipelines, respectively, this analysis shows that all of these are equivalent values. Thus pipeline capacity should be priced at its trading value, a prediction that can be empirically investigated. This paper also conducts an empirical analysis of this prediction based on transacted prices of transport contracts for the capacity of the Tennessee Gas Pipeline, a major interstate pipeline in the United States, and finds support for it. This analysis suggests that the uncertainty in the evolution of natural gas prices is an important driver of operational performance in the pricing of pipeline capacity. The results of this paper have potential relevance for the pricing of the capacity of other commodity conversion assets.|Nicola Secomandi||||||||||Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213||||||||||USA|||||||||

We take into account the risk and model the effect of a target by maximizing the satisficing measure of a newsvendor’s profit with respect to that target. We study two satisficing measures: (i) conditional value at risk (CVaR) satisficing measure that evaluates the highest confidence level of CVaR achieving the target; (ii) entropic satisficing measure that assesses the smallest risk tolerance level under which the certainty equivalent for exponential utility function achieves the target. For both satisficing measures, we find that the optimal ordering quantity increases with the target level.

We analyze a field experiment at the supplier Hugo Boss to determine how the supplier’s inventory service level affects demand from its retailer customers. We find increases in historical fill rate to be associated with statistically significant and managerially substantial increases in current retailer orders (i.e., demand, not just sales). Specifically, a one percentage point increase in fill rate, measured over the prior year, is associated with a statistically significant 11% increase in current retailer demand, controlling for other factors that might affect retailer demand.

We also examine whether team familiarity—team members' prior experience working with one another—helps teams to better manage challenges created by task changes and greater interpersonal team diversity. Using detailed project- and individual-level data from an Indian software services firm, we find that the interaction of task change with intrapersonal diversity is related to improved project performance, whereas the interaction of task change with interpersonal diversity is related to diminished performance. Additionally, the interaction of team familiarity with interpersonal diversity is related to improved project performance in some cases.

The basic research questions are whether the Nash equilibrium exists in this game, whether it is unique, and how the resulting inventories and prices are affected by competition. Using a novel method, we show the quasiconcavity of the competitive newsvendor's problem and establish the existence of the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. Through a contraction mapping approach, we develop sufficient conditions for the Nash equilibrium to be unique. We then analyze the properties of the equilibrium and compare it with the optimal solution for the (noncompeting) price-sensitive newsvendor. We prove that at a symmetric equilibrium, retail prices and safety stocks strictly increase with the proportion of a newsvendor's unsatisfied customers that switch to a competitor, but strictly decrease with the intensity of price competition. Total inventories, on the other hand, increase with the intensity of price competition. Furthermore, the competitive equilibrium never has lower safety stocks and higher retail prices (a situation that definitely hurts the customers) than the solution for noncompetitive newsvendors.|Xuan Zhao| Derek R.

This paper proposes the use of what are called responsibility tokens (RTs) to further facilitate that operationalization. The proposal assumes that a management information system, presumably electronic, is established to monitor inventories and shipment quantities, and to carry out transfer payments between players. As in Lee and Whang(1999), the incentives of the system are aligned, so if each player is brilliantly self-serving, the system optimal solution will result. While the system administrator need not know how the system should be managed, the most upstream player must know how to manage the system optimally for the system optimal solution to be achieved. RTs endow the system with an attractive self-correcting property: An example illustrates that upstream players are given a mechanism and the incentive to correct for downstream overordering. The downstream players who over-order are penalized, but system performance is not degraded much. Extensions and further research are also discussed.|Evan L.

A central element of such a model is its underlying operating policy. We focus on network contracts for the transport capacity of natural gas pipelines, specific energy conversion assets. Practitioners commonly manage these contracts as portfolios of spread options. Although computationally fast, we show that this approach in general is heuristic because of the suboptimality of its operating policy. We propose a different computationally efficient real option approach based on an optimal operating policy, integrating linear optimization and Monte Carlo simulation. We use our approach to benchmark the spread option approach in a numerical study based on market data and realistic instances. We find that our approach can substantially improve on the contract valuations computed by the spread option approach, especially for contracts with flexibility in their allowed capacity usage. We also show that the optimal operating policy of contracts with this flexibility is of the greedy type, whereas the one of contracts without it in general is not. However, we observe that greedy optimization yields a near-optimal operating policy for the latter type of contracts with a substantially reduced computational effort. A version of our model was recently implemented by a major international energy trading company. Our model can also be employed to efficiently estimate the contract value sensitivities (the “Greeks”), which merchants use for financial hedging purposes. Potentially, our work has wider significance for the merchant management of other commodity conversion assets with payoffs determined by solving capacity constrained optimization models.|Nicola Secomandi| Mulan X.

Excluding time for transportation, testing, and arrangement, clinically transfusable platelets have a mere three-day life span. This paper analyzes a periodic review inventory system for such a perishable product under two replenishment modes. Regular orders are placed at the beginning of a cycle. Within the cycle, the manager has an option of placing an additional order, referred to as an expedited order, characterized by an order-up-to level policy. For this platelet inventory problem, we prove the existence and uniqueness of an optimal policy that minimizes the expected cost. We then derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the policy, based on which an algorithm is developed. Using real-life data, we provide a numerical illustration and a sensitivity analysis followed by extensive simulation experiments to examine the dynamics of platelet inventory management. It is shown that the optimal cost is significantly affected by demand uncertainty, lead times, seasonality, and vintage of expedited orders. Given a hospital's demand profile and the cost parameters, we are able to determine whether the hospital should order daily or every other day (i.e., adopting a combined use of regular and optional expedited orders). We also show that the analytical solution is a good approximation of the optimal policy obtained from simulation experiments, where more realistic features are incorporated. This inventory research problem can be classified as a fixed-lifetime perishable problem with dual modes of replenishments.|Deming Zhou| Lawrence C. Leung| William P.

We first show that unlike in make-to-stock systems, a state-dependent base-stock list-price policy is optimal. The optimal state-dependent base-stock levels and list prices may increase or decrease as demand backlogs increase, whereas demand backlogs always improve the optimal expected profit. Because the problem easily becomes intractable under general system settings, we next develop a simple heuristic policy. The heuristic policy decouples inventory replenishment, pricing, and component allocation decisions in a coordinated way. We provide a sufficient condition that ensures the optimality of the heuristic policy, and present a numerical study to demonstrate its performance when the condition is not met. The numerical study also shows how the performance of the heuristic policy is affected by various market and operational conditions, and by the structure of the assemble-to-order system.

This is done by studying an infinite-server queueing model with time-varying arrival rate, exploiting a recently established heavy-traffic limit, allowing dependence among the service times. This limit shows that the number of customers in the system at any time is approximately Gaussian, where the time-varying mean is unaffected by the dependence, but the time-varying variance is affected by the dependence. As a consequence, required staffing to meet customary quality-of-service targets in a large-scale service system with finitely many servers based on a normal approximation is primarily affected by dependence among the service times through this time-varying variance. This paper develops formulas and algorithms to quantify the impact of the dependence among the service times on that variance. The approximation applies directly to infinite-server models but also indirectly to associated finite-server models, exploiting approximations based on the peakedness (the ratio of the variance to the mean in the infinite-server model). Comparisons with simulations confirm that the approximations can be useful to assess the impact of the dependence.|Guodong Pang| Ward Whitt|||||||||Harold and Inge Marcus Department of Industrial and Manufacturing Engineering, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802|Department of Industrial Engineering and Operations Research, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

We model the forecast of discrete demand as a band defined by the lower and upper bounds on demand, such that future forecasts lie within the current band. We develop a capacitated production planning model for a single product with terminal demand. We develop four heuristics for the problem and characterize their performance. In particular, two of the heuristics are optimal for the no holding-cost case. In our computational study, we analyze the performance of our heuristics and compare them to the optimal solution and to a simple heuristic that simulates common industrial practice using point forecasts. We find that two of our heuristics are very close to the optimal solution (less than 0.5% away from optimal on average under the conditions studied). Further, we consider forecast update patterns with primarily early, intermediate, and late information updates and provide insights on the effect of information update patterns on optimal costs.|Philip Kaminsky| Jayashankar M.

The test auction reveals incumbent supplier cost information that helps the buyer determine how many entrants (if any) to recruit at a cost prior to awarding the remaining units. The optimal number of entrant suppliers to recruit follows a threshold policy that is monotonic in the test auction’s clearing price unless the underlying supplier cost distribution is not regular. When setting her reserve price in the test auction, the buyer uses supplier recruitment as her “outside option”: if the reserve price is not met in the test auction, the buyer recruits new suppliers and runs a second auction. We compare the attractiveness of the test auction procedure relative to the more conventional procedure in which the buyer auctions off her entire demand in one auction. Since the buyer can choose ex ante which procedure to use, we propose using whichever has lower ex ante total (purchase plus recruitment) cost. Finally, using an optimal mechanism analysis, we find a lower bound on the buyer’s cost, and use that cost as a benchmark to show that our proposed sourcing strategy performs well given its ease of implementation.|Damian R.

A Bayesian scheme is employed to dynamically update the demand distribution for the problem with storable or perishable inventory and with exogenous or endogenous price. We show that the Weibull is the only newsvendor distribution for which the optimal solution can be expressed in scalable form. Moreover, for Weibull demand the cost function is not convex in general. Nevertheless, in all but the storable case, sufficient structure can be discerned so that the optimal solution can be easily computed. Specifically, for the perishable inventory case, the optimal policy can be found by solving simple recursions, whereas the perishable case with pricing requires solutions to more complex one-step look-ahead recursions. Interestingly, for the special case of exponential demand the cost function is convex, so that for the storable inventory case, the optimal policy can be found using simple one-step look-ahead recursions whereas for the perishable case the optimal policy can be expressed by exact closed-form formulas.|Arnab Bisi| Maqbool Dada| Surya Tokdar||||||||Krannert School of Management, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907|Johns Hopkins Carey Business School, Baltimore, Maryland 21202|Department of Statistical Science, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

But little is known about whether inventories have indeed decreased in U.S. manufacturing and whether such a decrease has been restricted to a few well-publicized firms or is true at an industry level. Using data published by the U.S. Census Bureau, the authors study trends in materials, work-in-process, and finished-goods inventory ratios during the period 1961 to 1994 in 20 manufacturing industry sectors and the total U.S. manufacturing sector to determine whether a significant decrease was seen in these ratios. Further, since a great deal of momentum for inventory reduction began in the early 1980s, the authors investigate whether greater improvement was seen in the post-1980 period as compared with the pre-1980 period. We find that material and work-in-process inventories did decrease in a majority of the two-digit industry sectors from 1961 to 1994 and showed greater improvement in about half the sectors in the post-1980 period relative to the pre-1980 period. Finished-goods inventories did decrease in some industry sectors and increase in a few others but did not show a significant trend in more than half the sectors. Total manufacturing inventory ratios decreased from 1961 to 1994 at all three stages—material, work-in-process, and finished goods. However, total manufacturing inventory ratios did not improve at a higher rate during the post-1980 period as compared with the pre-1980 period in any of the three stages.

We observe that teams with high dispersion of pairwise familiarity exhibit lower team productivity, and the existence of a “bottleneck-pair” may significantly hinder overall knowledge transfer capability, thus, productivity of fluid teams. In addition, we find that the higher the percentage of familiarity gained from complex tasks, the higher the productivity of the team.

The suppliers, who compete for business with the retailer by setting wholesale prices, are leaders in a Stackelberg game with the retailer. The retailer, facing uncertain future demand, chooses order quantities while weighing the benefits of procuring from the cheapest supplier against the advantages of order diversification. For the model with two suppliers, we show that low supplier default correlations dampen competition among the suppliers, increasing the equilibrium wholesale prices. Therefore the retailer prefers suppliers with highly correlated default events, despite the loss of diversification benefits. In contrast, the suppliers and the channel prefer defaults that are negatively correlated.

The first part of the paper contains fill-rate formulas for a single-stage system and general distributions of demand. When demand is normally distributed, an exact expression uses only the standard normal distribution and density functions, and a good approximation uses only the standard normal distribution function. The second part of the paper derives the probability distribution of the finished goods inventory level for serial systems with buffer inventories between stages. This distribution leads to fill-rate formulas and the conclusion that shorter supply chains have higher fill rates.|Matthew J.

We show what types of coordination mechanisms allow the decentralized supply chain to generate aggregate expected profits equal to the optimal profits in a centralized system, and how the parameters of these (perfect) coordination schemes can be determined. We assume that the retailers face stochastic demand functions that may depend on all of the firms’ prices as well as a measure of their service levels, e.g., the steady-state availability of the products.

The context and motivation for this work stem from a collaboration with an industrial partner, a Fortune 100 company that sells consumer electronics. The reverse logistics system is a closed-loop supply chain: failed devices are returned for repair and refurbishing; this inventory is then used to serve warranty claims or sold through a side sales channel. Managing inventory in this system is challenging because of the short life cycle of these devices and the rapidly declining value for the inventory. We examine an inventory model that captures these dynamics. We characterize the structure of the optimal policy for this problem for stochastic demand and introduce an algorithm to calculate optimal sell-down levels. We also provide a closed-form policy for the deterministic version of the problem, and we use this policy as a certainty-equivalent approximation to the stochastic optimal policy. Finally, using numerical experiments, we analyze the sensitivity of this system to changes in various parameters, and we also evaluate the performance of the certainty-equivalent approximation using data from our industrial partner.|Andre P.

We consider two scenarios in which this risk is borne by the OEM and CM, respectively. We determine which party should bear the risk so that maximum supply chain profits are achieved.

Anecdotal evidence and a growing number of research studies have advocated process flexibility and product innovation as organization-level operating capabilities critical for responding to such demands and uncertainties, and have highlighted the need for more efficient and effective management of the firm's knowledge-based resources. Leveraging arguments from the resource-based and knowledge-based views of the firm, we introduce a second-order latent construct called operational intellectual capital, which represents the organization's operating know-how embedded in a system of complementary (i.e., covarying) knowledge-based resources. We argue that operational intellectual capital influences organization-level operating capabilities such as process flexibility and product innovation, which, in turn, influence business performance. We empirically examine these relationships using structural equation modeling on a cross-section of U.S. manufacturing survey data. Statistical results from the estimation of a coalignment model and comparisons with several other models support our operational intellectual capacity conceptualization and its impact on operating capabilities and business performance, respectively. Our research thus suggests the importance of possessing and leveraging a system of complementary knowledge-based operating resources, and addresses the need for the reformulation of operations strategy theory in terms of the emergent knowledge-based view of the firm.|Larry J.

This paper examines how two defining features of an on-demand service platform—delay sensitivity and agent independence—impact the platform’s optimal per-service price and wage. Delay sensitivity reduces expected utility for customers and agents, which suggests that the platform should respond by decreasing the price (to encourage participation of customers) and increasing the wage (to encourage participation of agents). These intuitive price and wage prescriptions are valid in a benchmark setting without uncertainty in the customers’ valuation or the agents’ opportunity costs. However, uncertainty in either dimension can reverse the prescriptions: Delay sensitivity increases the optimal price when customer valuation uncertainty is moderate. Delay sensitivity decreases the optimal wage when agent opportunity cost uncertainty is high and expected opportunity cost is moderate. Under agent opportunity cost uncertainty, agent independence decreases the price. Under customer valuation uncertainty, agent independence increases the price if and only if valuation uncertainty is sufficiently high.|Terry A.

Flight delays have been attributed to several causes such as weather conditions, airport congestion, airspace congestion, use of smaller aircraft by airlines, etc. In this paper, we examine the impact of the scheduled block time allocated for a flight, a factor controlled by airlines, on on-time arrival performance. We analyze empirical flight data published by the Bureau of Transportation Statistics to estimate the scheduled on-time arrival probability of each commercial domestic flight flown in the United States in 2007 by a major carrier. The structural estimation approach from econometrics is then used to impute the overage to underage cost ratio of the newsvendor model for each flight. Our results show that airlines systematically “underemphasize” flight delays, i.e., the flight delay costs implied by the newsvendor model are less than the implied costs of early arrivals for a large fraction of flights. Our results indicate that revenue drivers (e.g., average fare) and competitive measures (e.g., market share) have a significant impact on the scheduled on-time arrival probability. We also show that the scheduled on-time arrival probability is not positively affected by the total number of passengers on the aircraft rotation who could be affected by a flight delay, or the number of incoming and outgoing connecting passengers on a flight. Operational characteristics such as the hub and spoke network structure also have a significant impact on the scheduled on-time arrival probability. Finally, full-service airlines put a higher weight on the cost of late arrivals than do low-cost carriers, and flying on the lowest fare flight on a route results in a drop in the scheduled on-time arrival probability.|Vinayak Deshpande| Mazhar Arıkan|||||||||Kenan-Flagler Business School, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, North Carolina 27599|School of Business, University of Kansas, Lawrence, Kansas 66045|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

Usually, companies manage supply chain risks by deferring payments to suppliers until after the delivery has been made. Even though the deferred payment approach shunts the risk from the buyer to the supplier, recent supply chain failures suggest that it does not necessarily eliminate the risk completely. Hence, many companies offer incentives and conduct inspections of the actions taken at the source rather than waiting for the end delivery. In this paper, we study the effectiveness of such incentive and inspection mechanisms undertaken by manufacturers to manage the quality of suppliers who are “privately” aware of the risk of failure. By comparing the agency costs associated with each contractual setting, we characterize the value of output- and action-based incentive mechanisms from the perspective of the manufacturer. We find that employing action-based incentives is effective for the manufacturer, specifically when working with a supplier that faces high costs of production and quality improvement. However, if the manufacturer faces high inspection costs or a low degree of information asymmetry, employing an output-based contract that results in differentiated quality improvement efforts becomes more effective. Finally, we analyze the marginal value of the combined contracting strategy and characterize when it strictly dominates over output- and effort-based contracts.|Mohammad E.

Working faster may result in greater output and less delay, but may result in lower quality and dissatisfied customers. In this work, we consider dynamic models in a monopoly setting to explore the optimal balance among the multiple dimensions of speed, price, and wait time. The impact of quality is captured via the market demand potential, which is a function of the speed (quality) in the previous period. We obtain several results and insights. First, in scenarios where speed may be difficult to change over time (e.g., some automated production lines) but price can be changed, we show that the optimal price charged is such that the demand rate remains constant over time, even though the price and market potential are changing. Furthermore, we identify conditions when the firm will work at a speed that is higher or lower than a benchmark speed and characterize the behavior of prices over time. Second, in scenarios where a firm may not be able to change prices but can adjust the speed each period, the firm starts at a speed that may be faster or slower than a benchmark speed but converges to it over time. In this constant price case, as the benchmark speed increases, the initial speed adopted by the firm is actually lower but increases more quickly thereafter. We also characterize the behavior of price and speed in settings where both can be changed over time. Interestingly, a firm typically starts at a slow speed and increases the speed, price, and demand over time. Although our main model assumes that the firm internalizes the congestion cost, several of our results extend to a scenario where the demand rate is impacted by the congestion level.|Vasiliki Kostami| Sampath Rajagopalan|||||||||London Business School, London NW1 4SA, United Kingdom|Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089|||||||||UNITED KINGDOM|USA||||||||

We test our hypotheses using data from the Carbon Disclosure Project's Supply Chain Program, a collaboration of multinational corporations requesting such information from thousands of suppliers in 49 countries. We find evidence that suppliers are more likely to share this information when requests from buyers are more prevalent, when buyers appear committed to using the information, when suppliers belong to more profitable industries, and when suppliers are located in countries with greenhouse gas regulations.

The cost of a false failure return includes the processing actions of testing, refurbishing (if necessary), repackaging, the loss in value during the time the product spends in the reverse supply chain (a time that can exceed several months for many firms), and the loss in revenue because the product is sold at a discounted price. This cost is significant and is incurred primarily by the manufacturer. Reducing false failure returns, however, requires effort primarily from the retailer, for example informing consumers about the exact product that best fits their needs. We address the problem of reducing false failure returns via supply chain coordination methods. Specifically, we propose a target rebate contract that pays the retailer a specific dollar amount per each unit of false failure returns below a target. This target rebate provides an incentive to the retailer to increase her effort, thus decreasing the number of false failures and (potentially) increasing net sales. We show that this contract is Pareto improving in the majority of cases. Our results also indicate that the profit improvement to both parties, and the supply chain, is substantial.|Mark Ferguson| V.

Consumers observe an imperfect private signal indicating which service facility may provide better service value as well as the queue lengths at the service facilities before making their choice. If more consumers choose the same service facility because of their private information, longer queues will form at that facility and indicate higher quality. On the other hand, a long queue also implies more waiting time. We characterize the equilibrium queue-joining behavior of arriving consumers and the extent of their learning from the queue information in the presence of such positive and negative externalities. We find that when the arrival rates are low, utility-maximizing rational consumers herd and join the longer queue, ignoring any contrary private information. We show that even when consumers treat queues as independently evolving, herd behavior persists with consumers joining longer queues above a threshold queue difference. However, if the consumers seek to minimize ex post regret when making their decisions, herd behavior may be dampened.|Senthil K. Veeraraghavan| Laurens G.

In this context, the SLA is a commitment by a supplier to achieve a minimum fill rate over a specified time horizon. This kind of SLA is an important, but understudied coordination mechanism. We focus on the impact of two contract parameters: the length of the review period and the magnitude of the bonus for meeting or exceeding the service-level target. For a supplier following a base stock (order-up-to) inventory policy, increasing the bonus increases optimal supplier stocking levels, whereas lengthening the review period may increase or decrease optimal stocking levels. We investigate these mechanisms in a controlled laboratory setting and find that longer review periods are generally more effective than shorter review periods in inducing higher stocking levels. As in several earlier laboratory studies, the explanation lies in the improved feedback reliability that longer review periods provide. The primary managerial implication of our findings is that, in practice, longer review periods may be more effective than shorter ones at inducing service improvements.|Elena Katok| Douglas Thomas| Andrew Davis||||||||Supply Chain and Information Systems Department, Smeal College of Business, Penn State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802|Supply Chain and Information Systems Department, Smeal College of Business, Penn State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802|Supply Chain and Information Systems Department, Smeal College of Business, Penn State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

Traditionally, rework is assigned back to the agent who generates the defect (in a self-routing scheme) or to another agent dedicated to rework (in a dedicated routing scheme). In contrast, a novel cross-routing scheme allocates rework to a parallel agent performing both new jobs and rework. The agent who passes quality inspection or completes rework receives the piece rate paid per job. We compare the incentives of these rework-allocation schemes in a principal-agent model with embedded quality control and routing in a multiclass queueing network. We show that conventional self-routing of rework cannot induce first-best effort. Dedicated routing and cross-routing, however, strengthen incentives for quality by imposing an implicit punishment for quality failure. In addition, cross-routing leads to workload-allocation externalities and a prisoner's dilemma, thereby creating the greatest incentives for quality. Firm profitability depends on demand levels, revenues, and quality costs. When the number of agents increases, the incentive effect of cross-routing reduces monotonically and approaches that of dedicated routing.|Lauren Xiaoyuan Lu| Jan A. Van Mieghem| R.

One undesirable effect of forecast updating is that it may lead to the bullwhip effect, a phenomenon where the variability of demand increases as one moves up the supply chain. The bullwhip effect can be undesirable for the supplier because more volatile orders from the downstream stage can be very costly to the supplier. It can make it more difficult for the supplier to forecast demand, and it can lead to large fluctuations in supplier production levels from period to period. Using ""stale"" or old forecasts may sound foolish, but their judicious use in a two-stage supply chain can improve fulfillment from the upstream stage to the downstream stage and reduce the fluctuations in production levels. We study a two-stage supply chain where the demand process is nonstationary and both stages use an adaptive base stock policy. We propose a policy that uses old forecasts to set base stock levels at the downstream stage while using current forecasts to communicate upcoming orders from the downstream stage to the upstream stage. We study a decentralized supply chain setting, and we find that our policy can reduce the expected supply chain inventory and shortage costs and significantly reduce the fluctuations in production levels compared to that of using current information. We also study a cooperative supply chain setting and, surprisingly, we find in numerical examples that our proposed policy results in very small increases in the expected systemwide inventory and shortage costs compared to a systemwide optimal policy, while reducing the fluctuations in production levels."|Julia Miyaoka| Warren Hausman|||||||||College of Business, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California 94132-4050|Department of Management Science & Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305-4026|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

Specifically, we consider a generalized version of the well-known “selling-to-the-newsvendor” model in which both the upstream and the downstream firms face stochastic input costs. The firms’ operations are intertwined—i.e., the downstream buyer depends on the upstream supplier for delivery and the supplier depends on the buyer for purchase. We show that if left unmanaged, the stochastic costs that reverberate through the supply chain can lead to significant financial losses. The situation could deteriorate to the point of a supply disruption if at least one of the supply chain members cannot profitably make its product. To the extent that hedging can ensure continuation in supply, hedging can have value to at least some of the members of the supply chain. We identify conditions under which the risk of the supply chain breakdown will cause the supply chain members to hedge their input costs: (i) the downstream buyer’s market power exceeds a critical threshold; or (ii) the upstream firm operates on a large margin, there is a high baseline demand for downstream firm’s final product, and the downstream firm’s market power is below a critical threshold. In absence of these conditions there are equilibria in which neither firm hedges. To sustain hedging in equilibrium, both firms must hedge and supply chain breakdown must be costly. The equilibrium hedging policy will (in general) be a partial hedging policy. There are also situations when firms hedge in equilibrium although hedging reduces their expected payoff.|Danko Turcic| Panos Kouvelis| Ehsan Bolandifar||||||||Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130|Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130|Chinese University of Hong Kong, Shatin, N.T., Hong Kong||||||||USA|USA|HONG KONG|||||||

Ways to balance demand and supply for electricity include using flexible generation resources, storage operations, and curtailing intermittent generation. This paper focuses on the operational and environmental impact of curtailing intermittent generation. We construct a stochastic dynamic optimization model that captures the critical components of the system operating cost and analyze how various generation resources should operate with and without curtailing intermittent generation. We find that the system cost reduction per unit of curtailed energy is consistently significant and the presence of storage may increase the cost saving per unit of curtailed energy.

The study of the cell's production technology provides us with insights that are potentially useful in industrial manufacturing. When comparing cell metabolism with manufacturing techniques in industry, we find some striking commonalities, but also some important differences. Like today's well-run factories, the cell operates a very lean production system, assures quality at the source, and uses component commonality to simplify production. While we can certainly learn from how the cell accomplishes these parallels, it is even more interesting to look at how the cell operates differently. In biological cells, all products and machines are built from a small set of common building blocks that circulate in local recycling loops. Production equipment is added, removed, or renewed instantly when needed. The cell's manufacturing unit is highly autonomous and reacts quickly to a wide range of changes in the local environment. Although this ""organic production system"" is very different from existing manufacturing systems, some of its principles are applicable to manufacturing, and indeed, a few can even be seen emerging today.

This paper studies how market demand conditions (i.e., the form of the demand function, demand uncertainty, and price-sensitive demand) drive coalition formation among complementary suppliers. In a deterministic demand model, we show that for an exponential or isoelastic demand function, suppliers always prefer selling in groups; for a linear-power demand function, suppliers may all choose to sell independently in equilibrium. These results are interpreted through the pass-through rate associated with the demand function. In an uncertain demand model, we show that, in general, the introduction of a multiplicative stochastic element in demand has an insignificant impact on stable coalitions and that an endogenous retail price (i.e., demand is price sensitive) increases suppliers' incentives to form alliances relative to the case with a fixed retail price. We also consider the impact of various other factors on stable outcomes in equilibrium, e.g., sequential decision making by coalitions of different sizes, the cost effect due to alliance formation (either cost savings or additional costs), and a system without an assembler.|Shuya Yin||||||||||Paul Merage School of Business, University of California鈥揑rvine, California 92697||||||||||USA|||||||||

We argue that individuals’ assessment of performance is also affected by the metric as opposed to solely based on the inventory value that actually matters. We perform three laboratory studies and analyze how decisions are affected by the metric used to indicate inventory performance. The first study considers alternative inventory optimizations, out of which one must be selected. The second study analyzes a decision maker who must decide on the effort to invest in optimizing inventory of a specific product. The third study corresponds to the economic order quantity model. Our behavioral models suggest that decisions are affected by the metric that is used to indicate performance, and we find support for the predictions in laboratory experiments with human subjects: Under the inventory turn rate metric, individuals overvalue inventory reductions. Compared to decisions under the days of supply metric, they choose worse inventory optimization options, invest more effort optimizing inventory of specific products, and choose higher ordering cost.|Tobias Stangl| Ulrich W.

For medical conditions requiring urgent attention, patients want quick access to a familiar physician. For such instances, it is important for clinics to have open slots that allow same-day (urgent) access. A major challenge when designing outpatient appointment systems is the difficulty of matching randomly arriving patients' booking requests with physicians' available slots in a manner that maximizes patients' satisfaction as well as clinics' revenues. What makes this problem difficult is that booking preferences are not tracked, may differ from one patient to another, and may change over time. This paper describes a framework for the design of the next generation of appointment systems that dynamically learn and update patients' preferences and use this information to improve booking decisions. Analytical results leading to a partial characterization of an optimal booking policy are presented. Examples show that heuristic decision rules, based on this characterization, perform well and reveal insights about trade-offs among a variety of performance metrics important to clinic managers.|Wen-Ya Wang| Diwakar Gupta|||||||||Industrial and Systems Engineering Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455|Industrial and Systems Engineering Program, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

Acting independently, supply chain partners fail to weigh the cost burden they impose on upstream suppliers when their replenishment order quantities vary from period to period. This paper explores a new approach to coordinate multiple stages in the supply chain by controlling, through appropriate downstream inventory management, the demand variability that is propagated to upstream stages. We propose and analyze a coordinated inventory replenishment policy that uses ""order smoothing"" to reduce order-size variability and thus reduce overall system costs, including both inventory and transportation costs. We characterize the optimal parameter values for smoothing alternatives (such as exponential smoothing and moving weighted average policies), assess their economic benefits, and develop insights regarding supply chain contexts that might benefit most significantly from reducing the variability of orders to upstream stages. Using the distribution network for specialty brand appliances as an illustrative example, we demonstrate the potential cost savings that order-smoothing strategies can yield compared to the uncoordinated case when individual firms separately minimize their costs. The magnitude of savings depends on several factors, including the variability in consumer demand, level of product variety, and degree of inventory aggregation in the distribution system. Based on our analytical results, we develop a framework to assess cost reduction opportunities through variability control for different supply chain scenarios."|Anantaram Balakrishnan| Joseph Geunes| Michael S.

Academic/practical relevance: Motivated by the steady growth in noncash donations from U.S. companies, our work is the first to provide theoretical guidance on operational planning under tax deduction for both precommitted donations and end-of-season donations. Methodology: We analyze the impact of tax deduction for a profit-driven firm under a two-period price-markdown newsvendor model and characterize the firm’s optimal price and quantity decisions. Results: The firm’s optimal donation behavior is driven by two factors—fixed cost and demand uncertainty. Specifically, a positive fixed cost can induce precommitted donation during the regular selling season, and demand uncertainty can induce end-of-season donation during the clearance period. Managerial insights: The enhanced tax deduction that is designed to encourage charitable donations results in unexpected behavior by the firm. For example, the firm’s optimal clearance price can increase with the amount of leftover inventory, and the firm’s optimal after-tax profit can increase as the tax rate increases. While the value of the deduction is tied to the fair market value (and the price) of the product, surprisingly, the firm may find it more profitable to charge a lower price, because the lower price may scale up the demand uncertainty and consequently increase the expected tax subsidy under the enhanced tax deduction. Our analysis reveals important insights about the impact of the tax law on a monopolist’s optimal operational decisions and profit.|Leon Yang Chu | Guang Li | Paat Rusmevichientong ||||||||Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089；|Smith School of Business, Queen’s University, Kingston, Ontario K7L 3N6, Canada；|Marshall School of Business, University of Southern California, Los Angeles, California 90089||||||||USA|CANADA|USA|||||||

By accepting preorders, the seller is able to obtain advance demand information for inventory planning and price discriminate the consumers. Given the preorder option, the consumers react strategically by optimizing the timing of purchase. We find that accurate demand information may improve the availability of the product, which undermines the seller's ability to charge a high preorder price. As a result, advance demand information may hurt the seller's profit due to its negative impact for the preorder season. This cautions the seller about a potential conflict between the benefits of advance demand information and price discrimination when facing strategic consumers. A common practice to contain consumers' strategic waiting is to offer price guarantees that compensate preorder consumers in case of a later price cut. Under price guarantees, the seller will reduce price in the regular season only if the preorder demand is low; however, such advance information implies weak demand in the regular season as well. This means that the seller can no longer benefit from a high demand in the regular season. Therefore, under price guarantees, more accurate advance demand information may still hurt the seller's profit due to its adverse impact for the regular season. We also investigate the seller's strategy choice in such a setting (i.e., whether the preorder option should be offered and whether it should be coupled with price guarantees) and find that the answer depends on the relative sizes of the heterogeneous consumer segments.|Cuihong Li| Fuqiang Zhang|||||||||School of Business, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut 06269|Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

We measure service by the probability of fulfilling a customer's entire demand immediately from stock. We characterize the optimal solution in several allocation policy classes; provide some structural results, formulas, and bounds; and also make detailed interpolicy comparisons.

This may extend the useful life of stable subsystems, reducing production and disposal impact. However, this argument ignores the effect of modular upgradability on a firm's development and introduction decisions and the environmental impact during the use phase. In this paper, we investigate when modular upgradability leads to lower environmental impact and higher profits. We do so by endogenizing a firm's development and introduction decisions and considering the product's environmental impact during its entire life cycle. Our results show that although modular upgradability may accelerate the replacement of some subsystems, it delays the replacement of others. We find that modular upgradability can increase the environmental impact for some product categories due to accelerated obsolescence arising from more frequent introduction and replacement. However, we also find that accelerated obsolescence, under some conditions, can actually make modular upgradability greener.|Vishal V.

If our assumptions hold, our model offers you a single numerical measure, called the degree of product/process innovation, to determine your initiative's impact on potential sales, prices, market segments, and profits. Our simple, single-period model is a variation of the existing vertically differentiated products model: There are two competing substitute products, and customers will buy at most one of them. Our contribution is to allow new relationships between the valuations of the two products by potential customers, and to allow differing unit production costs. We identify equilibrium results when two competing firms each offer one product, and find the profit maximizing result when one (monopolistic) firm offers both products. The new product infringes on the market in one of two ways: High-end encroachment results when the new product attracts the best customers (those with the highest reservation prices), while low-end encroachment identifies a situation where the new product attracts fringe (lower-end) customers. Low-end encroachment may help explain why an incumbent sometimes fails to recognize the threat of an entrant's product, as we illustrate with an example from the disk drive industry. In short, we offer insight into the value of both a marketing objective (enhancing the product design attributes) and a manufacturing goal (lowering the production cost) in a product and/or process improvement project.|Glen M.

To avoid double taxation, it permits tax cross-crediting. Through this strategy, global firms can use excess foreign tax credits (FTCs), the portion of foreign tax payments that exceed their home country tax liabilities, generated from a subsidiary located in a high-tax country to offset the tax liabilities of their low-tax divisions. This paper studies manufacturing capacity decisions in the subsidiary of an MNF with tax cross-crediting. Casting the problem on a newsvendor model, and assuming the objective of maximizing the global firm’s worldwide after-tax profits, we show that the optimal capacity decision under the effects of tax cross-crediting can behave very differently from that of the traditional newsvendor model. In particular, we show that an improvement in the firm’s after-tax profitability (through tax cross-crediting, an increased profit margin, or a reduced tax rate) might reduce the optimal capacity and that the optimal capacity decision under certain circumstances can be made without the knowledge of the demand distribution. We also discuss the issue of motivating the division manager to use an after-tax performance measure with a managerial tax rate.|Wenqiang Xiao| Vernon N.

Zenios|Department of EES&OR, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305;Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305|dynamic principal agent problem; incentives in operations management; maintenance|The principal-agent paradigm, in which a principal has a primary stake in the performance of some system but delegates operational control of that system to an agent, has many natural applications in operations management (OM). However, existing principal-agent models are of limited use to OM researchers because they cannot represent the rich dynamic structure required of OM models. This paper formulates a novel dynamic model that overcomes these limitations by combining the principal-agent framework with the physical structure of a Markov decision process. In this model one has a system moving from state to state as time passes, with transition probabilities depending on actions chosen by an agent, and a principal who pays the agent based on state transitions observed. The principal seeks an optimal payment scheme, striving to induce the actions that will maximize her expected discounted profits over a finite planning horizon. Although dynamic principal-agent models similar to the one proposed here are considered intractable, a set of assumptions are introduced that enable a systematic analysis. These assumptions involve the “economic structure” of the model but not its “physical structure.” Under these assumptions, the paper establishes that one can use a dynamic-programming recursion to derive an optimal payment scheme. This scheme is memoryless and satisfies a generalization of Bellman's principle of optimality. Important managerial insights are highlighted in the context of a two-state example called “the maintenance problem”.|Erica L. Plambeck| Stefanos A.

The facility operates in a random environment that represents the condition of the population that needs screening and diagnostic services, such as the disease prevalence level. We model the environment as a partially endogenous process: the population’s health can be improved by providing screening services, which reduces future demand for diagnostic services. We use event-based dynamic programming to build a framework for modeling different kinds of these facilities. This framework contains a number of service priority policies that are concerned with prioritizing screening versus diagnostic services. The main trade-off is between serving urgent diagnostic needs and providing screening services that may decrease future diagnostic needs. Under certain conditions, this trade-off reverses the famous cμ rule; i.e., the patients with lower waiting cost are given priority over the others. We define appropriate event operators and specify the properties preserved by these operators. These characterize the structure of optimal policies for all models that can be built within this framework. A numerical study on colonoscopy services illustrates how the framework can be used to gain insights on developing good screening policies.|E.

inventory"|This research studies the impact of improved forecasts on the members of a two-stage supply chain. The supplier builds capacity based on original forecast information, and the manufacturer places its order after observing improved (but imperfect) demand information. We study three types of wholesale price purchasing arrangements: (1) when the wholesale price is determined to be exogenous to the supply chain; (2) when the supplier sets the wholesale price; and (3) when the manufacturer sets the wholesale price. Although improved demand information reduces the demand uncertainty that the manufacturer faces, the manufacturer is constrained by the supplier's capacity decision. In all three cases, we show that improved information can decrease the supply chain's expected profit, even as the supplier's capacity increases with improved information. Because improved demand information always increases the centralized supply chain's expected profit, we present a contract that coordinates the channel and provides flexibility in dividing systemwide profit.|Miyaoka, Julia|Hausman, Warren H.|||||||||Decision Sciences Department, College of Business, San Francisco State University, San Francisco, California|Department of Management Science and Engineering, Stanford University, Stanford, California|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

The market is asymmetric because the buyers can carry inventory of the products ordered but the suppliers cannot store their capacity. In such a market, we might expect to see something like a price for capacity emerge to equilibrate demand and supply. The financial risk of participating in such a market will be driven by the volatility of the capacity price. In this paper we develop a model to explore the behavior of such a market and demonstrate, for example, that volatility of the price for capacity increases, to a point, when inflexibility of the capacity increases. We can also make statements about how the resolution of price uncertainty in the capacity market is related to the resolution of demand uncertainty faced by the buyers. Another contribution of the paper is to explain the role of market characteristics in how the market acts to minimize shortages caused by consumer demand uncertainty. We use continuous time stochastic optimal control techniques and numerical experiments to demonstrate these insights.|Amar Sapra| Peter L.

Examples of such settings are numerous and include those where limits are placed on the use of scarce natural resources as input or on the amount of waste or harmful pollution generated by production as output. We study the structure of the optimal production policy for such systems and show that it is determined by dynamic thresholds that depend only on the sum of the on-hand inventory level and the remaining allowance. We provide an effective approximate solution approach that can compute these thresholds efficiently while retaining their essential properties. We examine the differences between how an allowance constraint and a constraint on production capacity affect production decisions and show that they exhibit opposite effects over time. We also examine, in the context of an extended version of the problem where both the allowance amount and the production capacity are endogenous, optimal investments in allowance and production capacity and the impact of both on firm profit. We also consider the optimal demand fulfillment policy in settings where the firm can decide whether to back-order or to reject demand that cannot be satisfied from on-hand inventory.|Saif Benjaafar| David Chen| Rowan Wang||||||||Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota 55455|Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5R 2S3, Canada|Lee Kong Chian School of Business, Singapore Management University, Singapore 178899||||||||USA|CANADA|SINGAPORE|||||||

We examine the drivers of each firm's strategy, and the consequences for total sales, market share, and profitability. We show that the relative intensity of competition with respect to each competitive dimension plays a key role, as does the degree of cooperation between the retailers. We discover a number of insights concerning the preferences of each party regarding competition. For instance, there will be circumstances under which both retailers would prefer an increase in competitive intensity. Our analysis generalizes existing knowledge about manufacturer wholesale pricing strategies, and rationalizes behaviors that would not be evident without both price and service competition. Finally, we characterize the structure of wholesale pricing mechanisms that can coordinate the system, and show that the most commonly used formats (those that are linear in the order quantity) can achieve coordination only under very limiting conditions.|Andy A.
