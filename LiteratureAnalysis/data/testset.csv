Every job (or order) visits all assembly stations in the same sequence and spends the same amount of time (known as the production cycle) at each station. Industries such as aircraft, fire-engine, and automobile assembly have production cycles of a few hours and are labor intensive. In spite of increased automation in such industries, human capital remains the most expensive and important contributor to a flexible production system. In this article we formulate the cross-training problem on a paced assembly line with m stations (mCT). We assume that each worker possesses a number of skills referred to as a skill vector. Our objective is to schedule a set of work orders through the assembly system so as to minimize the size of the required workforce and/or the workforce cross-training costs. We analyze the complexity of mCT and identify polynomially solvable cases. A variety of lower bounds is developed based on optimization techniques. These lower bounds are used to develop a branch and bound algorithm as well as to evaluate our heuristics. A computational experiment reports the performance of all algorithms. Using these algorithms, we examine how the formation of skill vectors affects the workforce size and draw guidelines for cross-training programs in organizations with labor intensive assembly operations.|George Vairaktarakis| Janice Kim Winch|||||||||Case Western Reserve University, Department of OR and OM, 10900 Euclid Avenue, Cleveland, Ohio 44106-7235|Lubin School of Business, Department of Management and Management Sciences, One Pace Plaza, New York, New York 10038|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

However, in complex supply chains, it is not always obvious where to hold safety stock to minimize inventory costs and provide a high level of service to the final customer. In this paper we develop a framework for modeling strategic safety stock in a supply chain that is subject to demand or forecast uncertainty. Key assumptions are that we can model the supply chain as a network, that each stage in the supply chain operates with a periodic-review base-stock policy, that demand is bounded, and that there is a guaranteed service time between every stage and its customers. We develop an optimization algorithm for the placement of strategic safety stock for supply chains that can be modeled as spanning trees. Our assumptions allow us to capture the stochastic nature of the problem and formulate it as a deterministic optimization. As a partial validation of the model, we describe its successful application by product flow teams at Eastman Kodak. We discuss how these flow teams have used the model to reduce finished goods inventory, target cycle time reduction efforts, and determine component inventories. We conclude with a list of needs to enhance the utility of the model.|Stephen C. Graves| Sean P. Willems|||||||||Leaders for Manufacturing Program and A. P.

The manufacturer, via the use of financial levers at her disposal, wishes to coordinate this decentralized chain while making a profit. We model the physical scenario as one of constant displayed inventory level (on which demand rate depends positively) and continuous replenishment. With a single retailer, we show that to coordinate the channel and make a profit the manufacturer needs to augment the wholesale price lever by another-an inventory holding costs subsidy offered to the retailer. When multiple retailers compete in that product's market, there are two ways to envision and model the demand and market split. One assumes that market demand depends on aggregate inventory displayed, and then splits according to individual display levels. The other “assigns” customers to retailers according to their display levels, and then assumes that purchases are a function of the display level at the retailer selected. We characterize retailers' Nash equilibria in these models, and we explore whether the manufacturer can coordinate such channels.|Yunzeng Wang| Yigal Gerchak|||||||||Department of Operations Research & Operations Management, Weatherhead School of Management, Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio 44106|Department of Management Sciences, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario, Canada N2L 3G1, and Department of Industrial Engineering, Tel-Aviv University, Ramat-Aviv, Tel-Aviv, Israel 69978|||||||||USA|ISRAEL||||||||

We posit that the impact on manufacturing quality, measured as the defect rate trajectory, is monotonically nonincreasing over time and may, more specifically, assume the shape of an inverted S-curve. Employing a longitudinal research design, we investigate four work teams over a 28-month period in a field setting. Each team corresponds to one of the four interconnected production lines in an electromechanical assembly plant operated by a Fortune 500 firm. Results of our empirical analysis support the sustainability of quality improvements associated with work team implementation and partially support the S-shaped trajectory as the particular form of sustainability. However, variations in the manufacturing quality trajectories reflect the characteristics of the work team and the production line on which each the team is instituted. From the standpoint of practice, this study highlights the importance of work-team design and implementation decisions, especially the need to be proactive in identifying and resolving initial implementation difficulties.|Rajiv D.

The question of whether there is empirical evidence that services, specifically retail banks, display the characteristics of agility like their manufacturing counterparts is open to debate. Conventional wisdom in operations management posits that most successful services trade off one capability for another. Drawing from the resource-based view of the firm, combinative capabilities view, and the cybernetics work of Ashby (1958), theoretical arguments suggest the contrary. The agility paradigm is viable in environments calling for a mix of strategic responses. Applying cluster analytic techniques to a sample of retail banks, using capabilities as taxons, we identify four strategic service groups: agile, traditionalists, niche, and straddlers. Our empirical results provide thematic explanations consistent with theory that account for how the agile strategic group offers a unique configuration of service concept, resource competencies, strategic choices, and business orientation. Profiles of the operations strategies of each strategic service group suggest that each group has found a fit between what certain segments of the market may want and what they have to offer. In particular, we found that the agile group exhibited greater resource competencies than its counterparts, requiring greater investments in infrastructure and technology. Consistent with theory, agile banks performed better over time on an absolute measure of return on assets.|Larry J. Menor| Aleda V. Roth| Charlotte H.

This paper studies a finite-horizon capacity expansion problem (CEP) with deferred capacity expansion. The operating cost and the cost of holding unused capacity in each period depend on the time when the capacity is acquired, and the shortage cost depends on the time when the shortage occurred. Our model is a generalization of the Wagner-Whitin formulation of the CEP and an extension (with deferred expansion) of two other polynomially solvable CEPs in the literature. We explore structural properties of the problem and develop an efficient dynamic programming algorithm to solve the problem in polynomial time.|Vernon Ning Hsu||||||||||Department of Industrial Engineering and Engineering Management, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong and School of Management, George Mason University, Fairfax, Virginia 22030||||||||||USA|||||||||

The optimization results provide some evidence that an efficient portfolio provides significantly greater risk and return benefits compared to individual programs and external benchmarks.

Because the product is ill defined at this point in time, the buyer is unable to commit to the future terms of trade through a court-enforceable contract. Instead, to provide incentives for capacity investment, the buyer informally promises future terms of trade. The prospect of future interaction creates an incentive for the buyer to pay the supplier as promised. We characterize optimal price-only and price-and-quantity promises and compare their performance. If the production cost is low and either the capacity cost is low or the discount factor is high, then the buyer should promise to purchase a specific quantity rather than simply promise to pay a per unit price; otherwise, the buyer should simply promise to pay a specified unit price.|Terry A.

One method that can be applied in such cases uses dispersion among forecasting experts as a measure of demand uncertainty. This paper provides a test for this method and presents a heteroscedastic regression model for estimating the variance of demand using dispersion among experts' forecasts and scale. We test this methodology using three data sets: demand data at item level, sales data at firm level for retailers, and sales data at firm level for manufacturers. We show that the variance of a random variable (demand and sales for our data sets) is positively correlated with both dispersion among experts' forecasts and scale: The variance increases sublinearly with dispersion and more than linearly with scale. Further, we use longitudinal data sets with sales forecasts made three to nine months before the earnings report date for retailers and manufacturers to show that the effects of dispersion and scale on variance of forecast error are consistent over time.|Vishal Gaur| Saravanan Kesavan| Ananth Raman| Marshall L.

In particular, we say an industry exhibits the bullwhip effect if the variance of the inflow of material to the industry (what macroeconomists often refer to as the variance of an industry's “production”) is greater than the variance of the industry's sales. We find that wholesale industries exhibit a bullwhip effect, but retail industries generally do not exhibit the effect, nor do most manufacturing industries. Furthermore, we observe that manufacturing industries do not have substantially greater demand volatility than retail industries. Based on theoretical explanations for observing or not observing demand amplification, we are able to explain a substantial portion of the heterogeneity in the degree to which industries exhibit the bullwhip effect. In particular, the less seasonal an industry's demand, the more likely the industry amplifies volatility—highly seasonal industries tend to smooth demand volatility whereas nonseasonal industries tend to amplify.|Gérard P.

Our focus is on the structure of the optimal markdown mechanisms in the presence of rational or strategic buyers who demand multiple units. We first examine a complete information setting where the set of customer valuations is known but the seller does not know the valuation of each individual customer (i.e., cannot exercise perfect price discrimination). We then generalize our analysis to an incomplete valuation information setting where customer valuations are drawn from known distributions. For both settings, we compare the seller's profit resulting from the optimal markdown mechanism and the optimal single price.

We incorporate a detailed consumer channel choice model in which the demand faced in each channel depends on the service levels of both channels as well as the consumers' valuation of the product and shopping experience. The direct channel's service is measured by the delivery lead time for the product; the retail channel's service is measured by product availability. We identify optimal dual channel strategies that depend on the channel environment described by factors such as the cost of managing a direct channel, retailer inconvenience, and some product characteristics. We also determine when the manufacturer should establish a direct channel or a retail channel if he is already selling through one of these channels. Finally, we conduct a sequence of controlled experiments with human subjects to investigate whether our model makes reasonable predictions of human behavior. We determine that the model accurately predicts the direction of changes in the subjects' decisions, as well as their channel strategies in response to the changes in the channel environment. These observations suggest that the model can be used in designing channel strategies for an actual dual channel environment.1|Kay-Yut Chen| Murat Kaya| Özalp Özer||||||||Hewlett-Packard Laboratories, Palo Alto, California 94304|Sabanci University, Istanbul, 34956, Turkey|Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305||||||||USA|TURKEY|USA|||||||

Yet the theory on the value of component commonality is rather limited in the inventory literature. The existing results were built primarily on single-period models or periodic-review models with zero lead times. In this paper, we consider a continuous-review system with positive lead times. We find that although component commonality is in general beneficial, its value depends strongly on component costs, lead times, and dynamic allocation rules. Under certain conditions, several previous findings based on static models do not hold. In particular, component commonality does not always generate inventory benefits under certain commonly used allocation rules. We provide insight on when component commonality generates inventory benefits and when it may not. We further establish some asymptotic properties that connect component lead times and costs to the impact of component commonality. Through numerical studies, we demonstrate the value of commonality and its sensitivity to various system parameters in between the asymptotic limits. In addition, we show how to evaluate the system under a new allocation rule, a modified version of the standard first-in-first-out rule.|Jing-Sheng Song| Yao Zhao|||||||||Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708, and Antai College of Economics and Management, Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200052 China|Department of Supply Chain Management and Marketing Sciences, Rutgers University, Newark, New Jersey 07102|||||||||CHINA|USA||||||||

The main estimators considered are: (i) the delay of the last customer to enter service (LES), (ii) the delay experienced so far by the customer at the head of the line (HOL), and (iii) the delay experienced by the customer to have arrived most recently among those who have already completed service (RCS). We compare these delay-history estimators to the standard estimator based on the queue length (QL), commonly used in practice, which requires knowledge of the mean interval between successive service completions in addition to the QL. We characterize performance by the mean squared error (MSE). We do an analysis and conduct simulations for the standard GI/M/s multiserver queueing model, emphasizing the case of large s. We obtain analytical results for the conditional distribution of the delay given the observed HOL delay. An approximation to its mean value serves as a refined estimator. For all three candidate delay estimators, the MSE relative to the square of the mean is asymptotically negligible in the many-server and classical heavy-traffic (HT) limiting regimes.|Rouba Ibrahim| Ward Whitt|||||||||IEOR Department, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027|IEOR Department, Columbia University, New York, New York 10027|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

The greater this confidence, the lesser is the importance of psychological safety in facilitating knowledge sharing. Linking this result to social network theory, we find that psychological safety increases with the frequency of communication among coworkers and that the confidence of employees in their knowledge is related to the codifiability of the knowledge involved.

Demand is, however, often difficult to characterize, especially in new or nonstationary markets. In this paper, we develop robust formulations for the capacity allocation problem in revenue management using the maximin and the minimax regret criteria under general polyhedral uncertainty sets. Our approach encompasses the following open-loop controls: partitioned booking limits, nested booking limits, displacement-adjusted virtual nesting, and fixed bid prices. In specific problem instances, we show that a booking policy of the type of displacement-adjusted virtual nesting is robust, both from maximin and minimax regret perspectives. Our numerical analysis reveals that the minimax regret controls perform very well on average, despite their worst-case focus, and outperform the traditional controls when demand is correlated or censored. In particular, on real large-scale problem sets, the minimax regret approach outperforms by up to 2% the traditional heuristics. The maximin controls are more conservative but have the merit of being associated with a minimum revenue guarantee. Our models are scalable to solve practical problems because they combine efficient (exact or heuristic) solution methods with very modest data requirements.|Georgia Perakis| Guillaume Roels|||||||||Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02139|Anderson School of Management, University of California, Los Angeles, California 90095|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

The firm sells a product in a single selling season and can exert marketing effort to influence consumer demand. We develop a modeling framework to quantify the value of improving supply reliability and investigate how this value depends on different model parameters. Our results provide useful insights into how firms should make investment decisions on adopting new technologies to improve supply reliability. First, we establish a necessary and sufficient condition under which the maximum unit cost a firm is willing to pay to improve supply reliability increases in product price. We further show that this condition would hold in most practical situations. Thus, with some caveats, our result supports the intuition that a firm is willing to pay more to improve supply reliability for products with a higher price. Next, we show that for two products with the same price, a firm is willing to pay more to improve supply reliability for the product with a higher product cost. This implies that it is not necessarily true that emerging technologies for improving supply reliability should be first adopted for products with the highest unit contribution margin. Finally, we show that a product with a lower marketing cost function always benefits more from improved supply reliability than a product with a higher marketing cost function. This finding suggests that the priority of adopting new technologies should be given to situations where the firm can effectively induce greater demand through promotional effort.|Shaoxuan Liu| Kut C.

For a good that has two periods of lifetime, we build a model that generalizes and/or subsumes many of the models in the literature and study the effectiveness of two intuitive heuristic (base-stock) replenishment policies combined with different substitution rules. For each replenishment policy, we identify sufficient conditions on cost parameters for a substitution rule to be economically superior to others under our base-stock replenishment policies. Our analysis shows that the replenishment policy almost universally advocated in the perishable inventory literature may lead to pathological behavior when used with issuance rules that pool inventory (via substitution) to satisfy multiple, age-differentiated demand streams. Furthermore, we find that system behavior is typically more predictable, and potentially less costly, under a policy long-discarded in the literature that ignores the inventory of aged items, ordering a constant amount each period. Thus the benefit of pooling inventory for substitutable, perishable products depends critically on the replenishment policy used.|Borga Deniz| Itir Karaesmen| Alan Scheller-Wolf||||||||Joseph W.

In our setting, the product is a complex health insurance plan. The firm incurs substantial costs in serving the customers through its call center and in adjudicating the claims using its information systems. The firm sells either standard plans or in some instances allows customer groups to customize their plans by adding and modifying certain aspects in active collaboration with the firm. Such a collaboration process is akin to the firm cocreating products with its customers. This cocreation process should increase customers' familiarity with their coverage and improve the fit with their medical needs. Better fit and familiarity in turn, reduces customers' incentives to contact the call center for clarifications regarding the firm's product coverage. In particular, we show that customers with a customized plan call 21% less frequently than customers with a standard plan. Our results account for possible self-selection of customers to customized plans. We also show no difference in the claims adjudication cost between a standard and a customized plan exists. Overall, our results suggest customized plans may be operationally cheaper to serve than standard plans. Thus, our paper provides a link between a growing business concern (customer support cost via call centers) and a prevalent business strategy (product customization via cocreation).|Anuj Kumar| Rahul Telang|||||||||The Heinz College School of Information Systems and Management, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213|The Heinz College School of Information Systems and Management, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

We find that the length of stay for patients admitted to the ICU is influenced by the occupancy level of the ICU. In particular, a patient is likely to be discharged early when the occupancy in the ICU is high. This in turn leads to an increased likelihood of the patient having to be readmitted to the ICU at a later time. Such “bounce-backs” have implications for the overall ICU effective capacity—an early discharge immediately frees up capacity, but at the risk of a (potentially much higher) capacity requirement when the patient needs to be readmitted. We analyze these capacity implications, shedding light on the question of whether an ICU should apply an aggressive discharge strategy or if it should follow the old quality slogan and “do it right the first time.” By comparing the total capacity usage for patients who were discharged early versus those who were not, we show that an aggressive discharge policy applied to patients with lower clinical severity levels frees up capacity in the ICU. However, we find that an increased number of readmissions of patients with high clinical severity levels occur when the ICU is capacity constrained, thereby effectively reducing peak bed capacity.|Diwas Singh KC| Christian Terwiesch|||||||||Goizueta Business School, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322|The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19104|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

Given the process characteristics of the waste-to-energy operation, the market characteristics for waste disposal and energy, and the mechanisms regulators use to encourage production of renewable energy, we determine the profit-maximizing operating strategy of the firm. We also show how regulatory mechanisms affect the operating decisions of the waste-to-energy firm. Our analyses suggest that if the social planner's objective is to maximize landfill diversion, offering a subsidy as a per kilowatt-hour for electricity is more cost effective, whereas if the objective is to maximize renewable energy generation, giving a subsidy as a lump sum to offset capital costs is more effective.

In this paper, we study three mechanisms for dealing with product adulteration problems: (a) the deferred payment mechanism—the buyer pays the supplier after the deferred payment period only if no adulteration has been discovered by the customers; (b) the inspection mechanism—the buyer pays the supplier immediately, contingent on product passing the inspection; and (c) the combined mechanism—a combination of the deferred payment and inspection mechanisms. We show that the inspection mechanism cannot completely deter the suppliers from product adulteration, whereas the deferred payment mechanism can. Surprisingly, the combined mechanism is redundant: either the inspection or the deferred payment mechanisms perform just as well. Finally, we identify four factors that determine the dominance of deferred payment mechanism over the inspection mechanism: (a) the inspection cost relative to inspection accuracy, (b) the buyer's liability for adulterated products, (c) the difference in financing rates for the buyer and the supplier relative to the defects discovery rate by customers, and (d) the difference in production costs for adulterated and unadulterated product. We find that the deferred payment mechanism is preferable to inspection if the threats of adulteration (either incentive to adulterate or the consequences) are low.|Volodymyr Babich| Christopher S.

Investment buying (IB), forward buying in anticipation of drug price increases, used to be the way the distributors made most of their profits. FFS contracts limit the amount of inventory distributors can carry at any time (by imposing an inventory cap) and require inventory information sharing from the distributors to the manufacturers while compensating the distributors with a per-unit fee. In spite of its widespread popularity, the FFS model has never been rigorously analyzed or its effectiveness carefully tabulated. In this paper, we formulate the multiperiod stochastic inventory problems faced by the manufacturer and the distributor under the FFS and IB models, derive their optimal policies, and develop procedures to compute the policy parameters. We show that FFS contracts can improve the total supply chain profit—the manufacturer and distributor are now able to share a larger pie. Thus, there exists a range of the per-unit fees that leads to Pareto improvement. Simulation results show that such improvement is approximately 1.7% on average, and as much as 5.5%, and the improvement increases as the inventory cap decreases. Determining the Pareto-improving per-unit fees is a source of contention in FFS contract negotiation, and we propose a simple yet effective heuristic for computing them. Furthermore, supply chain transparency facilitated by the FFS contracts can significantly reduce the manufacturer's supply–demand mismatch costs (by approximately 3.63% on average and as much as 13.01%) and we show that the manufacturer should take advantage of this transparency especially when the inventory cap and drug price increase are high and demand variance is low. We believe that these results have the potential to improve the efficiency of pharmaceutical distribution supply chains, thus reducing the healthcare costs that are such a big burden on the U.S. economy.|Hui Zhao| Chuanhui Xiong| Srinagesh Gavirneni| Adam Fein|||||||Smeal College of Business, Pennsylvania State University, University Park, Pennsylvania 16802|School of Business, University of North Carolina at Pembroke, Pembroke, North Carolina 28372|Nanyang Business School, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore 639798|Pembroke Consulting Inc., Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19102|||||||USA|USA|SINGAPORE|USA||||||

Clinical quality measures hospitals' performance on patient safety, i.e., adherence to standards, whereas experiential quality relates to patient centeredness, i.e., responsiveness to the needs and preferences of the patient. Drawing from the organizational learning literature, we argue for a trade-off between clinical and experiential quality as hospitals emphasize process management. We also study how external and internal forces, i.e., state legislation and hospital leadership, influence this relationship. A combination of primary data and secondary data collected at various time intervals is employed to test our hypotheses. Four important implications emerge from this work. First, we find that hospitals' emphasis on process management is associated with an increase in clinical quality but a decrease in experiential quality. Second, we find that state legislation initially reinforces this trade-off but, overtime, facilitates a positive impact of process management on both quality outcomes. Third, a post hoc analysis suggests that a specific type of hospital leadership, namely, patient-centered leadership, helps mitigate the negative association between process management and experiential quality. Finally, our research provides preliminary evidence regarding the relationship between clinical quality and patient satisfaction contingent on experiential quality.

The inequity in the distribution of surface water arises because of the relative physical locations of the farms. Head-reach (primary) farms are close to the source, whereas tail-end (secondary) farms are relatively farther. The lack of physical infrastructure implies that water allocated to secondary farms must pass through primary farms. Left to their individual incentives, primary farmers use more than their fair share of water by denying its release to secondary farmers. Such an inequitable sharing results in significantly suboptimal productivity of the farming community as a whole. We propose decentralized, individually rational mechanisms to achieve socially optimal distribution of surface water for a farming community under uncertainty in rainfall, choice of multiple crops, and differing risk-bearing abilities of primary and secondary farmers. We show that the mechanisms can be efficiently computed and highlight the impact of the improved sharing of surface water. We also study the movement of the price of water with its scarcity.

We model the first two strategies as single-period Stackelberg games, and we model the last strategy as a two-period dynamic Stackelberg game. By comparing the equilibria of these games, we formalize our understanding of several intuitive results. For example, from the manufacturer's perspective, dynamic selling dominates advance selling and regular selling: having more selling opportunities is beneficial to the manufacturer. However, from the retailer's perspective, we find two counterintuitive results: (a) postponing the ordering decision can be detrimental—the retailer can be worse off under regular selling than under advance selling; and (b) more ordering opportunities can be detrimental—the retailer can be worse off under dynamic selling than under advance selling. In addition, we analyze the impact of supply and demand uncertainties under these strategies and find that both types of uncertainties can be beneficial to the retailer.|Soo-Haeng Cho| Christopher S.

However, lead-time pricing studies ignore such delay refunds. This paper contributes to filling this gap. It studies revenue-maximizing tariffs that depend on realized lead times for a provider serving multiple time-sensitive customer types. We relax two key assumptions of the standard model in the lead-time pricing literature. First, customers may be risk averse (RA) with respect to payoff uncertainty, where payoff equals valuation, minus delay cost, minus payment. Second, tariffs may be arbitrary functions of realized lead times. The standard model assumes risk-neutral (RN) customers and restricts attention to flat rates. We report three main findings: (1) With RN customers, flat-rate pricing maximizes revenues but leaves customers exposed to payoff variability. (2) With RA customers, flat-rate pricing is suboptimal. If types are distinguishable, the optimal lead-time-dependent tariffs fully insure delay cost risk and yield the same revenue as under optimal flat rates for RN customers. With indistinguishable RA types, the differentiated first-best tariffs may be incentive-compatible even for uniform service, yielding higher revenues than with RN customers. (3) Under price and capacity optimization, lead-time-dependent pricing yields higher profits with less capacity compared to flat-rate pricing.|Philipp Afèche| Opher Baron| Yoav Kerner||||||||Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3E6, Canada|Rotman School of Management, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3E6, Canada|Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva 84105, Israel||||||||CANADA|CANADA|ISRAEL|||||||

We examine how unexpected performance along several dimensions of service quality—on-time performance, long delays and cancellations, lost bags, and denied boardings—impacts contemporaneous stock returns. Prior research suggests that airlines buffer their flight schedules and engage in expensive employee incentive programs to increase the likelihood of on-time arrival. We find that only long delays are penalized by the market, and we identify a number of carrier-specific factors that alter the financial impact of long delays. We find that the penalty a carrier faces for long delays is significantly higher if it operates a high percentage of short-haul or connecting flights, or if its competitors incur fewer long delays in the same time period.

The firm also has access to financial contracts written on the commodity price, such as futures contracts and call and put options. We examine different cases of financial hedging, for example, single-contract and multicontract hedges. For each case, we dynamically maximize the mean-variance utility of the firm's cash flow and characterize an optimal integrated policy of inventory and hedging, which is easy to compute and implement. We find that as long as futures are used in each period, alone or not, the optimal inventory policy is myopic. The optimal hedging policy, however, is never myopic, but depends on all the future optimal decisions. This is contrary to findings of the literature using intraperiod utility functions, which finds myopic hedging to be optimal. Moreover, we find that hedging may lead to inventory reduction in multiperiod problems. Thus the insights from the single-period studies in the literature—hedging leads to inventory increase—do not apply. Finally, insights are offered on the role and impact of inventory and financial hedge on profitability, variance control, and service level, using both analytical and numerical results.|Panos Kouvelis| Rong Li| Qing Ding||||||||Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130|Olin Business School, Washington University in St. Louis, St. Louis, Missouri 63130; and Nankai Business School, Nankai University, 300071 Tianjin, China|Lee Kong Chian School of Business, Singapore Management University, Singapore 178899||||||||USA|CHINA|SINGAPORE|||||||

We characterize the complementarity of the recyclate ratio, defined as the maximum recycled content, with material versatility and miniscaling of recycling plants. We also observe that it is beneficial to coordinate investments in recycling- and production-related competencies because colocated recycling and production plants (minimills) eliminate recyclate transport. We therefore consider versatile miniplants, defined as a competency that factors in both material versatility and coordinated miniscaling of recycling and production plants, and capture how it complements both the recyclate ratio and localization of production plants, a competency that takes advantage of local adaptation and customer proximity. In numerical examples for rolled aluminum and nylon resin plant networks in Europe, we find that the complementarity effects are large, as they are for nylon resins, if recycling is nascent and challenging economically and if the plant network is too centralized at first to benefit much from an increased recyclate ratio or increased localization. We find that, for the nylon resin network, considering an investment in the recyclate ratio as part of a coordinated investment plan drives the emergence of a decentralized and localized minimill network, even though an increased recyclate ratio does not link directly with either decentralization or localization. We conclude that material recycling, versatile miniplants, and localization can fit well together in a forward-looking, sustainable operations strategy.|Lieven Demeester| Mei Qi| Luk N.

What complicates this decision is the fact that the projected dollar savings from the more sustainable technologies fluctuate considerably due to uncertainty in fuel prices, and the total capacity may not be utilized at 100% because of fluctuations in the demand for the product. We consider the firm's capacity adjustments over time given a portfolio of technology options when the demand and the fuel costs are stochastic and possibly dependent. Our model also allows for usage-based capacity deterioration.

The sales agent is working mainly at the retailer's location to boost demand. We focus on a wholesale price contract, under which the retailer decides how much to order from the manufacturer. The information structure within the supply chain and the efficiency of the sales agent affect the supply chain members' expected profits. We show that, because of the agency issue between the sales agent and the manufacturer, when the retailer's demand forecast accuracy is similar to the manufacturer's and the wholesale price is fixed, the retailer's profit decreases as his demand forecast accuracy improves. We also illustrate that when the retailer's forecast accuracy is much better than the manufacturer's and the wholesale price is endogenous, his expected profit decreases as his forecast accuracy improves. Moreover, we demonstrate that having a more efficient sales agent is beneficial for the retailer when the wholesale price is fixed, whereas this is not always the case when the wholesale price depends on the efficiency of the sales agent.|Neda Ebrahim Khanjari| Seyed Iravani| Hyoduk Shin||||||||School of Business, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey, Camden, New Jersey 08102|McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science, Northwestern University, Evanston, Illinois 60208|Rady School of Management, University of California, San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

The demand captured by a firm depends on the gap between the firm's offer and the benchmark. We refer to the benchmark effect as the impact of this gap on demand. The formation of the benchmark is endogenous and depends on both firms' choices. When the benchmark is equal to the shorter of the two offered delays, we characterize the unique Pareto optimal Nash equilibrium. Our analysis reveals a stickiness effect in which firms equate their delays at the equilibrium when the benchmark effect is sufficiently strong. When the benchmark corresponds to a weighted average of the two offered delays, we show the existence of a pure Nash equilibrium. In this case, we reveal a reversal effect, in which the market leader, i.e., the firm that offers a shorter delay, becomes the follower when the benchmark effect is sufficiently strong. In both cases, we show that customers' equilibrium waiting times are shorter with the benchmark effect than without it. Our models also capture customers' loss aversion, which, in our setting, states that demand is more sensitive to the gap between the delay and the benchmark when the delay is longer than the benchmark (loss) than when it is shorter (gain). We characterize the impact of this loss aversion on the equilibrium in both settings. Finally, we show numerically that the stickiness and reversal effects still exist when firms also compete on price.|Liu Yang| Francis de Véricourt| Peng Sun||||||||School of Economics and Management, Tsinghua University, Beijing 100084, China|INSEAD, 77305 Fontainebleau, France|Fuqua School of Business, Duke University, Durham, North Carolina 27708||||||||CHINA|FRANCE|USA|||||||

It is assumed that the suppliers are allocated static fractions of demand. We prove that for normally distributed demand an extreme point property holds. We present a real example from the industrial electronics industry consisting of five echelons and three dual-sourced materials. This example forms the basis for a numerical analysis.

Partially procuring supply in the forward market, rather than entirely in the spot market, is thus a potentially valuable real option, which we call the forward procurement option. We investigate the optimal value and management of this real option as well as their sensitivities to parameters of interest. Our research quantifies the value of the forward procurement option on realistic natural gas instances, also suggesting that procuring the demand forecast in the forward market is nearly optimal. This policy greatly simplifies the management of this real option without an appreciable loss of value. We provide some theoretical support for this numerical finding.

In this paper, we consider an online display advertising setting in which a web publisher posts display ads on its website and charges based on the cost-per-click pricing scheme while promising to deliver a certain number of clicks to the ads posted. The publisher is faced with uncertain demand for advertising slots and uncertain traffic to its website as well as uncertain click behavior of visitors. We formulate the problem as a novel queueing system, where the slots correspond to service channels with the service rate of each server inversely related to the number of active servers. We obtain the closed-form solution for the steady-state probabilities of the number of ads in the publisher's system. We determine the publisher's optimal price to charge per click and show that it can increase in the number of advertising slots and the number of promised clicks. We show that the common heuristic used by many web publishers to convert between the cost-per-click and cost-per-impression pricing schemes using the so-called click-through-rate can be misleading because it may incur substantial revenue loss to web publishers.

In this paper, we study the impact of two major barriers to mass adoption of EVs: (i) range anxiety, the concern that the driving range of EVs may be insufficient to meet the driving needs, and (ii) resale anxiety, the concern that used values of EVs may deteriorate quickly. Using a stylized model calibrated to a data set based on the San Francisco Bay Area, we show that although both types of consumer anxieties typically harm the firm’s profit, they often improve consumer surplus. In addition, we show that a business model that requires consumers to lease the EV batteries (rather than purchase them) may lead to a greater level of adoption and emission savings when the level of resale anxiety is high. Further, a business model that offers EV range improvement through enhanced charging infrastructure typically yields greater adoption and consumer surplus, but lowers the firm’s profit, compared with one that offers enlarged batteries. Overall, we find that the combinations of battery owning/leasing with enhanced charging service, referred to as the (O, E) and (L, E) models in our paper, typically yield the best balance among the objectives of EV adoption, emission savings, profitability, and consumer surplus, when the degree of resale anxiety is low and high, respectively.|Michael K.

To do this entails the management of a distribution network with more decision options than a traditional retailer. The online retailer, not the customer, decides from where items will ship, by what shipping method, and how or whether multiple-item orders will be broken up into multiple shipments. What is the best way to fulfill each customer’s order to minimize average outbound shipping cost? We partner with an online retailer to examine this question. We develop a heuristic that makes fulfillment decisions by minimizing the immediate outbound shipping cost plus an estimate of future expected outbound shipping costs. These estimates are derived from the dual values of a transportation linear program (LP). In our experiments on industry data, we capture 36% of the opportunity gap assuming clairvoyance, leading to reductions in outbound shipping costs on the order of 1%. These cost savings are achieved without any deterioration in customer service levels or any increase in holding costs. The transportation LP also serves as the basis for a metric that provides information on the quality of the inventory position. Based on initial successful piloting, our industrial partner has implemented the metric as well as a version of the heuristic that it is applying to every fulfillment decision for each of its stock keeping units in North America.|Jason Acimovic| Stephen C.

We consider a model in which a retail firm announces a pair of declining prices for two selling periods, and customers with heterogeneous valuations each decide whether to buy a unit early, later or never. In this model, if the demand function is linear and its parameters are common knowledge, there never exist any markdown prices that achieve temporal discrimination for any feasible model parameters. Either all buying customers wait, or all buy early. By contrast, if the demand level is unknown, there always exists a temporally discriminating markdown pricing scheme for all feasible model parameters. We derive qualitative insights to the way demand uncertainty and Bayesian updating contribute to temporal discrimination, which broadly apply to nonlinear demand functions as well. We also show that in case of demand uncertainty, there always exists a temporally discriminating pricing scheme that yields a strictly higher profit to the retailer than the optimal static pricing scheme. Ironically, however, the retailer cannot implement the optimal scheme due to the same demand uncertainty.|Seungjin Whang||||||||||Graduate School of Business, Stanford University, Stanford, California 94305||||||||||USA|||||||||

P. Carey School of Business, Arizona State University, Tempe, Arizona 85287|wine futures; advance selling; quality uncertainty; pricing|This study examines the use of wine futures (i.e., advance selling of wine before it is bottled) as a form of operational flexibility to mitigate quality rating risk. At the end of a harvest season, the winemaker obtains a certain number of barrels of wine that can be produced for a particular vintage. While the wine is aging in the barrel, expert reviewers taste the wine and create a barrel score, indicating the potential quality of the wine and offering clues as to whether, when bottled, it will be superior wine. Based on the barrel score, the wine producer determines (1) the percentage of its wine to be sold as futures and (2) the price of the wine futures. After one more year of aging, the wine is bottled, and the reviewers provide a second review of the wine and assign a bottle score that influences the market price of the wine. Our study makes three contributions. First, we develop an analytical model that incorporates uncertain consumer valuations of wine futures and bottled wine and the uncertain bottle rating that is assigned to the wine at the end of the production process. Our analysis provides insights into how the barrel score, consumer preference (through a conditional-value-at-risk perspective) and the winemaker’s preference influence the winemaker’s allocation and pricing decisions. Our second contribution relates to the impact of consumer heterogeneity on the optimal allocation and pricing decisions. Contrary to common belief that the winemaker may be better off when consumers are more homogeneous, our results demonstrate that the winemaker can achieve a higher level of profitability when the market is filled with consumers that are heterogeneous.

Our empirical analysis demonstrates that (1) barrel scores play a significant role in the two decisions regarding the quantity and price of wine futures, and (2) the wine futures market provides a sizable financial benefit to the winemakers.

One motivation behind this behavior is to reduce double marginalization through coordinated pricing so that system efficiency is improved and individual members can also benefit. The objective of this paper is to understand how competition in supply chains would impact such joint selling partnerships among complementary suppliers. We first model competition at the supply level, which is generated from the existence of multiple partially substitutable brands (or suppliers) for a particular component. We then extend the analysis to a model that also involves retail competition caused by decentralization among retailers who assemble suppliers' components into final products and sell to customers. The analysis of a model with two complementary components, one of which has multiple brands, indicates that the supply-level competition discourages joint selling of complementary goods. That is, when competing brands become more alike (or substitutable), complementary suppliers act more independently in pricing and selling their items. However, retail competition leads to an opposite effect: Competition among retailers would actually encourage complementary suppliers to package their goods together and act jointly.|Yuhong He| Shuya Yin|||||||||Mihaylo College of Business and Economics, California State University, Fullerton, Fullerton, California 92834|Paul Merage School of Business, University of California, Irvine, Irvine, California 92697|||||||||USA|USA||||||||

The paper investigates how salespeople use the information provided to them to set prices; of particular interest is how salespeople use price recommendations from a decision support tool. The investigation builds reduced-form models and tests them on a data set obtained by a grocery products distributor. The analysis shows that salespeople’s decisions are explained well by a two-stage decision model whereby salespeople make an initial decision on whether or not to change the price (a binary decision) and then decide on the magnitude of change (a continuous response). We find that salespeople in our data set do not blindly adopt the recommended price change generated by the pricing tool. Rather, our two-stage model allows for us to uncover a nuanced association between the recommended price and the actual price change by identifying customer-specific and salesperson-specific market factors that moderate the influence of price recommendations.|Wedad Elmaghraby| Wolfgang Jank| Shu Zhang| Itir Z.

Demand information is censored, the exact time of stockout is not observed, and the short selling season often does not allow for replenishment. Using data for 26,749 book titles from 2007 to 2011 and a simulation experiment calibrated on real data, we show that an attribute-based choice model generates accurate demand estimates (mean absolute percentage error less than 1%) even when nearly 90% of the textbooks in the fit sample experience stockout. This performance is driven by the heterogeneity of product attributes and is robust to the occurrence of product returns. We implement this model at the bookstore in a controlled field experiment and obtain over 10% increase in profit. The results show that accounting for asymmetric and stockout-based substitution in demand estimation and inventory planning enables us to make systematic corrections in inventory mix and inventory level compared to the existing process.|Joonkyum Lee| Vishal Gaur| Suresh Muthulingam| Gary F.

How can buyers motivate suppliers to exert greater care to prevent such harm? This paper characterizes a “backfiring condition” under which actions taken by prominent buyers (increasing auditing, publicizing negative audit reports, providing loans to suppliers) motivate a supplier to exert greater effort to pass the buyer’s audit by hiding information and less care to prevent harm. Intuitively appealing actions for a buyer (penalizing a supplier for harming workers or the environment, or for trying to deceive an auditor) may be similarly counterproductive. Contrary to conventional wisdom, squeezing a supplier’s margin (by reducing the price paid to the supplier or increasing wages for workers) motivates the supplier to exert greater care to prevent harm—under the backfiring condition. Whereas the necessary and sufficient condition depends on the relative convexity of the supplier’s hiding cost function, a simple sufficient condition is that the supplier is likely to successfully hide information from the auditor, in equilibrium. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the backfiring condition is prevalent or becoming increasingly so. Similar insights apply to mitigation of unauthorized subcontracting.|Erica L. Plambeck| Terry A.

The cost criterion we use to evaluate inventory policies for this system is the sum of the expected long-run average holding and shortage costs. It is well known that for this problem, characterizing the structure of the optimal policy and computing it are very difficult. We consider the use of echelon base-stock policies for our system (even though they are known to be suboptimal) and propose algorithms for finding base-stock levels that are easy to understand and implement. We derive bounds on the ratios between the costs achieved by our algorithms and the optimal costs (over all policies). For light-tailed demand distributions, our algorithms are shown to be asymptotically optimal in the sense that our bounds are close to one in high service-level environments. Our computational investigations reveal that our algorithms perform well even under modest service levels.|Woonghee Tim Huh| Ganesh Janakiraman| Mahesh Nagarajan||||||||Operations and Logistics Division, Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada V6T 1Z2|Naveen Jindal School of Management, The University of Texas at Dallas, Richardson, Texas, 75080|Operations and Logistics Division, Sauder School of Business, University of British Columbia, Vancouver, Canada V6T 1Z2||||||||CANADA|USA|CANADA|||||||

Laboratory tests may be processed in parallel and thus have a limited effect on patients’ waiting times; imaging tests, by contrast, require patient presence and thus directly influence patients’ waiting times. We use a strategic queueing framework to model a physician’s decision of ordering imaging tests and show that insurance coverage is the key driver of overtesting. Our further analysis reveals the following: (i) Whereas existing studies hold that lower out-of-pocket expenses lead to higher consumption levels, we refine this statement by showing the copayment and the coinsurance rate drive the consumption in different directions. Thus, simply expanding patient cost sharing is not the solution to overtesting. (ii) Setting a low reimbursement ceiling alone cannot eliminate overtesting. (iii) The joint effect of misdiagnosis concerns and insurance coverage can lead to both overtesting and undertesting even when no reimbursement ceiling exists. These and other results continue to hold under more general conditions and are therefore robust. We enrich our model along two extensions: one with patient heterogeneity in diagnostic precision, and the other with disparities in health insurance coverage. Our findings have implications for other healthcare settings with similar trade-offs.|Tinglong Dai| Mustafa Akan| Sridhar Tayur||||||||Carey Business School, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland 21202|Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213|Tepper School of Business, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15213||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

In this paper, we consider problems of allocating a carshare fleet to service zones under uncertain one-way and round-trip rental demand. We employ a two-stage stochastic integer programming model, in the first stage of which we allocate shared vehicle fleet and purchase parking lots or permits in reservation-based or free-floating systems. In the second stage, we generate a finite set of samples to represent demand uncertainty and construct a spatial–temporal network for each sample to model vehicle movement and the corresponding rental revenue, operating cost, and penalties from unserved demand. We minimize the expected total costs minus profit and develop branch-and-cut algorithms with mixed-integer, rounding-enhanced Benders cuts, which can significantly improve computation efficiency when implemented in parallel computing. We apply our model to a data set of Zipcar in the Boston–Cambridge, Massachusetts, area to demonstrate the efficacy of our approaches and draw insights on carshare management. Our results show that exogenously given one-way demand can increase carshare profitability under given one-way and round-trip price differences and vehicle relocation cost whereas endogenously generated one-way demand as a result of pricing and strategic customer behavior may decrease carshare profitability. Our model can also be applied in a rolling-horizon framework to deliver optimized vehicle relocation decisions and achieve significant improvement over an intuitive fleet-rebalancing policy.|Mengshi Lu| Zhihao Chen| Siqian Shen ||||||||Krannert School of Management, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana 47907|Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109|Department of Industrial and Operations Engineering, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48109||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||

We study the manufacturers’ price-setting interactions and how these can be manipulated by the retailer’s assortment strategy. We show that constraining the breadth of the assortment has two main effects on retailer profits: First, a larger assortment may intensify competitive pressure and decrease prices because manufacturers need to fight harder for market share. Second, a smaller assortment may also reduce manufacturer prices because manufacturers want to ensure that they are included in the chosen assortment, which may lead to higher profits despite lower variety and possibly lower revenues. We optimize retailer assortment strategies, taking into account these two effects. We find that when the manufacturers’ products are very different in terms of attractiveness, the first effect dominates while the second effect is stronger when products are comparable. Finally, our findings require that retailers communicate the assortment strategy properly: retailers should not disclose the identity of the chosen manufacturers, but should commit to a given assortment breadth.|H.

However, recent studies suggest an association between the age of transfused RBCs and adverse clinical outcomes for their recipients. Therefore, there is an interest in inventory management policies that could reduce the age of transfused RBCs without compromising their availability. In this work, we study the performance of a practical family of threshold-based allocation policies, designed to trade off the age of RBC transfusions with their availability at hospitals. To this end, we consider a stylized model of a hospital blood bank that procures its required blood from local donations. For this model, we develop a new method to exactly evaluate the performance of the threshold policy in terms of the distribution of the age of allocated units and the proportion of outdates and lost demand. Through numerical and structural results, we obtain new insights on the performance of the threshold policy and in particular on how it compares with shortening the shelf life of RBCs (e.g., from 42 to 28 days). We verify and discuss the robustness of these results to the model assumptions in a simulation study calibrated using data from a Canadian hospital blood bank.|Vahid Sarhangian | Hossein Abouee-Mehrizi | Opher Baron| Oded Berman|||||||Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario M5S 3G8, Canada|Department of Management Sciences, University of Waterloo, Waterloo, Ontario N2L 3G1, Canada|Joseph L.

substitutable products"|We consider a practical dynamic pricing problem with two substitutable products involving a number of business rules commonly seen in practice. Demand substitution exists between the two products (interproduct substitution) and may also exist across different time periods (intertemporal substitution). However, there is limited demand information such that the underlying probability distributions of the demand cannot be characterized precisely. We use an interval to represent, respectively, the demand for each individual product in each period, the aggregate demand for the two products in each period, and the total aggregate demand for the two products across multiple time periods. We propose a robust optimization model for this problem to maximize the worst-case total revenue. For the problem with interproduct demand substitution only, we develop a dynamic programming algorithm and show that the search spaces in the DP can be reduced greatly, which enables the algorithm to generate optimal solutions in a reasonable amount of time. For the problem with both interproduct and intertemporal demand substitutions, we develop a more complex dynamic programming algorithm and design a fully polynomial time approximation scheme that guarantees a proven, near optimal solution in a manageable computation time for practically sized problems. Our computational results show that, compared to a risk-neutral approach, our robust optimization approach can decrease the variance of the revenue at a small expense of the average revenue. We also generate a number of managerial insights: (i) none of the key structural properties commonly studied in the pricing literature hold for our problem; (ii) the revenue impact of ignoring intertemporal demand substitution when such substitution exists can be quite significant; and (iii) under- or overestimating the bounds of the demand intervals or imposing moderate business rules leads to relatively small revenue loss, typically less than 3%.|Ming Chen | Zhi-Long Chen|||||||||College of Business Administration, California State University, Long Beach, California 90840|Robert H.

To create transparency requires a company to both gain visibility into its supply chain and disclose information to consumers. In this paper, we focus on the dimension of visibility and investigate when companies can benefit from greater supply chain visibility. To do so, we design an incentivized human–subject experiment to study two key questions: (i) How does supply chain visibility impact consumers’ valuations of a company’s social responsibility (SR) practices in its upstream supply chain? (ii) What roles do indirect reciprocity and consumers’ prosociality play in affecting their valuations under different levels of visibility? In our design, greater visibility is represented by lower uncertainty in the outcomes of a company’s SR efforts. Our results show that consumers value greater visibility regarding a company’s SR practices in the upstream supply chain. This is especially true if consumers exhibit a self-serving bias and use uncertainty as an excuse not to pay for SR. We also observe that high prosocial consumers do not exhibit strong indirect reciprocity. Conversely, indirect reciprocity significantly increases low prosocial consumers’ valuations under High visibility. Our work adds to the experimental literature focusing on transparency and SR (which has primarily studied disclosure) by examining the equally important but understudied dimension of visibility. Furthermore, our results on consumer heterogeneity offer insights into what SR information resonates with a company’s target consumers.|Tim Kraft | León Valdés | Yanchong Zheng ||||||||Darden School of Business, University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia 22904；|Katz Graduate School of Business, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, C15260；|Sloan School of Management, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Cambridge, Massachusetts 02142||||||||USA|USA|USA|||||||
